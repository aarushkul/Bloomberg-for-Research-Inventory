        "briefSummary": "Tumours of central nervous system (CNS) is the most common type of solid tumour in childhood. In China, there is limited epidemiology information. Released data from Chinese CDC did not include types of CNS tumours and geographic contribution. As the Children's Neuro-Oncology Group (CNOG) was established in China in May 2017, it makes studies from multiple centers in children's brain tumors become practical. This retrospective cross-sectional study was aligned on CNOG annual meeting in 2018 and research group was named as CNOG-MC001 (MC, multicenter) collaborative group.",
        "detailedDescription": "CNS tumours are mostly seen solid tumours in childhood , as the second common malignancy following leukemia in children. The annual age-standardized incidence rate per 1,000,000 person-years (ASR) of CNS tumour in international children's cancer incidence study is 20-30. In Asia, ASR of paediatric CNS tumours is around 15.0-24.9 in Japan, Korea, Singapore. For Chinese races including mainland of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, ASRs of paediatric CNS tumour are 15.0, 17.4 and 23.8.\n\nIn 2017 in Shanghai, Children's Neuro-Oncology Group (CNOG) was found in 5th CSPN (Chinese Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery) / 9th CPNF (China Pediatric Neurosurgery Forum) conference, with 35 founding member institutions and 30 founding observation member institutions in mainland of China. Based on this progress, national wide registry (CNOG-MC001) was settled to obtain basic information about CNS tumour cases, combined with available epidemiology data from publications to assess current medical situation on paediatric CNS tumours in China. The protocol of CNOG-MC001 was aligned by CSPN and CNOG member institutions in CNOG annual meeting in 2018 and the study ofiicially started right after the meeting on 20181027.\n\nThe first step of this study is a national wide pre-survey to all 35 CNOG member institutions and other 22 CSPN members. The pre-survey data sheet included number of annual surgically treated paediatric CNS tumour cases (age ranging from 0 to 18 years old, classified by WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System 2016 version), to assess the proper sites to be involved in this study. After retrieving the pre-survey results, large-scale, detailed case data sheets will be sent to participating institutions as members of CNOG-MC001 collaborative group."

It will profile the immune response to IRE of unresectable pancreatic cancers. The intra-tumoral and systemic immune response to IRE will be determined and compared to pre-ablated pancreatic cancer specimens and historical control specimens.",
        "detailedDescription": "Thirty patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (\u22645.0cm) will undergo percutaneous irreversible electroporation of the tumor using CT and ultrasound guidance. Blood will be drawn for research before IRE. Blood and tissue samples will be used.\n\nAfter IRE, patients will be carefully monitored and systemic immune responses are registered. Follow-up will consist of frequent CT and MRI scanning, as well as serum CA19.9 tumor marker and quality of life questionnaires and overall survival (OS).\n\nThe investigators hypothesize that IRE in the pancreas will induce good symptom palliation without causing severe complications as well as perfect systemic immune response."

        "detailedDescription": "Background: Insertion of sheath in the radial artery in connection with examination and treatment of patients with coronary artery disease is usually performed by specialized invasive cardiologists or trainees. Whether sheath insertion can be performed by nurses with the same level of comfort and pain is uncertain.\n\nEligibility: Patients referred for coronary angiography (CAG) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to suspicion of coronary artery disease are included\n\nRandomization: Patients are randomized 1:1 to sheath insertion by nurse or physician\n\nMethods: Insertion of 5 or 6 radial sheaths is performed in local anesthesia\n\nOutcome measures: Comfort and pain level is registered from immediately after sheath insertion until start of CAG/PCI.\n\nAdditional outcome measures: Oximetry test is performed immediately after sheath removal - and repeated after 1 month in case of occlusion. Any complication is recorded from the patient enters the wake-up room until discharge.\n\nAll patients are contacted after 1 year in order to register adverse events."
