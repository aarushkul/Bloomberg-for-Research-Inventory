          "detailedDescription": "Calcified lesions posed a significant challenge in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The existence of calcified plaque increased the difficulty of optimal stent expansion and the risk of target lesion failure(TLF). Consequently, optimizing the preparation techniques for calcified lesions before stent implantation has assumed growing importance.\n\nAs a kind of novel double-layered balloon, super high-pressure balloon can expand uniformly under extreme pressure. Previous studies have demonstrated that super high-pressure balloon perform non-inferiorly or superiorly to other strategies in terms of final stent expansion.\n\nThrough triggering localized pulsatile sonic pressure, intravascular lithotripsy(IVL) cracked intimal and medial calcium plaque within the artery. In present series of studies(DISRUPT), the optimized preparation of calcified lesions with IVL has been proved to be safe and effective. According to guidelines and clinical practice, IVL is applicable to different types of severe calcification lesions, including concentric and eccentric calcifications. However, considering its technological and economic costs, finding other preparation techniques non-inferiority to IVL was essential. In clinical practice, super high-pressure balloon had shown considerable effects of preparation for calcified lesions. However, study focused on the comparison of super high-pressure balloon with IVL for severe calcified lesions was limited.\n\nIn summary, this randomized trial aimed to evaluate the stent expansion through optical coherence tomography (OCT) among individuals underwent different preparation techniques ,then comparing the efficacy and safety of super high-pressure balloon to IVL in severely calcified lesions"

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate whether new imaging techniques can help us to better understand the cardiac amyloidosis. The disease can be slowed down with various medications (e.g., tafamidis, acoramidis, or vutrisiran). However, treatment is not effective in all patients-in about one-third of cases, the disease continues to progress. So far, we know little about the exact causes of this and what biological changes occur in the heart muscle.\n\nThe main question it aims to answer is:\n\nWill new imaging techniques help us understand the course of the cardiac amyloidosis?\n\nParticipants will have additional examinations:\n\n* At the beginning of the study: one additional heart ultrasound examination, one cardiac MRI and one cardiac PET, blood examination during the regular examination, questionnaires.\n* After a year: one additional heart ultrasound examination, one cardiac MRI and one cardiac PET, blood examination during the regular examination.\n\nTime required:\n\n* Heart ultrasound examination: 5-10 Minutes\n* Cardiac MRI: 2 hours\n* Cardiac PET: 2 hours\n* Questionnaires: 5-10 Minutes.",
          "detailedDescription": "Experimental Design The study design is an open label prospective longitudinal study with serial imaging at baseline and after 12-month follow-up. The entire study population will include 50 participants with cardiac ATTR amyloidosis, as recently defined by multi-societal criteria.\n\nConventional markers of disease progression\n\nThese markers are collected during routine clinical follow-up of patients in our Outpatient Clinic. The markers are divided into three domains and include the following outcomes:\n\n* Clinical and functional: any heart failure hospitalization, NYHA class, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, 6-minute walk test;\n* Laboratory biomarkers: NT-proBNP, troponin, creatinine;\n* Imaging and ECG: LV wall thickness, diastolic dysfunction, LVEF, stroke volume, global longitudinal strain, conduction disturbance.\n\nData Analysis Plan Power calculation for sample size is challenging as no previous study has evaluated the response of our endpoints in myocardial FAPI uptake or serum BMP4 concentration to tafamidis. We therefore focused sample size calculation of echocardiographic myocardial stiffness. Based on our own preliminary data, we estimate median baseline values for myocardial stiffness of 2.6 m/s \\[IQR, 1.7-3.8\\] in cardiac amyloidosis. Disease progression is expected in about 30% of participants. While myocardial stiffness is expected to remain unchanged in cardiac amyloidosis without disease progression a 20% relative increase (i.e. 0.5 ± 0.5 m/s) is considered in cardiac amyloidosis with disease progression. A sample size of 40 participants (i.e. 30 participants without and 10 participants with disease progression) has a statistical power of 80% to predict a difference in response of myocardial stiffness to tafamidis.\n\nNon-normally distributed, paired data of repeated measures (i.e. longitudinal changes per group) are compared by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Non-normally distributed unpaired data of changes (i.e. longitudinal changes between groups) are compared by Mann-Whitney test. The correlations are compared by a z-test on Fisher z-transformed correlation coefficients."

The investigators hypothesize that DRIVESC can detect measurable changes in driving-related cognitive and motor performance across blood alcohol concentrations up to the U.S. per se legal limit of 0.08% g/210L ethanol. The study will enroll healthy adults aged 18-64 years (including both dosed and zero-alcohol arms) participating in the Wisconsin Breath Alcohol Examiner Specialist course, with each participant completing two study visits over two days.",
          "detailedDescription": "A total of 18-22 participants will be enrolled in this single-site partial crossover pilot study. Under the auspices of the Wisconsin Basic Breath Examiner Specialist training, participants will be dosed with alcohol on the first, second, or neither day of the three-day training.\n\nThis study design includes 6 double-alcohol-negative participants who will complete two days of alcohol-negative study tasks. The investigators will consider enrolling 12 alcohol-positive participants a success but are aiming to enroll 16 alcohol-positive participants. Alcohol-positive participants will complete two days of study tasks where one day is alcohol-negative and the other day is alcohol-positive. The order of positive-negative and negative-positive will be balanced. This range allows for flexibility in this feasibility study as study activities are scheduled in coordination with and around Chemical Testing Section training activities to minimize disruption to their educational tasks."

These miRs will be used to characterize the overall immune state in adult heart transplant patients and predict patients that will go on to develop infection and rejection. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression and serve as molecular biomarkers found in the circulation.",

Patients will be screened for eligibility and enrolled \\~1 month (± 2 weeks) after transplant. Study participation will last 36 months.\n\nAll patients will follow the center's standard of care surveillance schedule after transplant. Blood samples will be collected for miR evaluation at:\n\n1. specified time intervals after transplant and\n2. when a clinical event of interest occurs, including treated rejection, or infection.\n\nResearch samples will be collected and used to evaluate miR expression as well as other biomarkers related to heart transplantation and immunosuppression medications. Additional data collection will include demographics, medical history, medications, human leukocyte (HLA)/donor specific antibody (DSA) evaluations, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) echocardiography, donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA), and other post-transplant events and testing.\n\nThis work will form the basis for a non-invasive, genomic blood test that can be used to monitor patients after heart transplant to mitigate complications of over-immunosuppression, such as infection, without increasing the risks of under-immunosuppression, such as rejection."

Seventy-four patients were assessed between 2014 and 2023. Patients with identifiable structural pathology underwent lesion-specific surgical correction, while those without detectable lesions but with neuropathic nocturnal pain underwent decompression of the median nerve. Pain intensity was measured using the visual analogue scale (VAS) preoperatively, at 10-12 days, and at three months. The study aims to determine the speed and magnitude of pain improvement after targeted surgical intervention.",
          "detailedDescription": "Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a multifactorial neuropathic pain disorder that can occur after trauma or surgery and is often resistant to conservative treatment. Increasing evidence suggests that in a subset of patients, peripheral mechanical factors contribute significantly to symptom generation. This prospective clinical study evaluated the outcomes of targeted surgical treatment in patients with CRPS of the upper limb who met the Budapest diagnostic criteria.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2023, seventy-four patients were examined. Thirty-eight patients presented with identifiable structural pathology, such as hardware impingement, neuroma, tendon adhesion, or scar tethering, and underwent lesion-specific surgical correction. Thirty-six patients had no detectable structural lesion but reported nocturnal neuropathic pain suggestive of median nerve irritation; these patients underwent decompression of the median nerve. Pain intensity was measured using the visual analogue scale (VAS) before surgery, at suture removal (10-12 days), and at three months postoperatively.\n\nPatients with identifiable mechanical pathology demonstrated substantial improvement, with an average 7.2-point VAS reduction after six months. Patients who underwent median nerve decompression showed rapid and marked pain reduction, improving by 7.1 points within 10-12 days and 8.6 points within three months. Acute CRPS cases improved more than chronic ones, indicating an early therapeutic window before central sensitization becomes dominant. Only one chronic case failed to improve. The results suggest that timely surgical assessment and correction of peripheral nerve or soft-tissue factors may lead to rapid and significant clinical recovery in selected CRPS patients."

          "briefSummary": "Hypermobile EDS and hypermobile spectrum disorder (collectively referred to as hEDS) are estimated to affect 1 in 500 individuals worldwide. hEDS patients have limited treatment options for their numerous symptoms that impact the quality of life. This clinical trial tests a new ear stimulation method in hEDS patients to determine if it may improve quality of life.",
          "detailedDescription": "The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of heritable, connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility2. Hypermobile EDS (hEDS) is the most common type of EDS and is estimated to affect 1 in 500 individuals worldwide1. Note that there are specific clinical criteria for hEDS and those who do not meet all of them but have a number of similar symptoms are usually classified with hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD). When investigators use the term hEDS investigators include those with HSD as well. hEDS is characterized by broad tissue/organ involvement across multiple systems and incomplete penetrance. Of particular interest for the proposed work, the vagus nerve has afferent and efferent interactions with nearly all of the affected systems (i.e., cardiovascular, GI, immune system, neurologic function). hEDS is a chronic and debilitating disease that oftentimes begins during childhood and worsens at the time of puberty3. In general, hEDS affects women more severely than men and they are more frequently diagnosed. Treatment options are limited to symptom management and may include physical therapy, bracing and mobility aids, pain management and medication for co-morbid conditions. Surgical intervention is frequent in hEDS patients with an average of 4-5 surgeries required prior to the age of 25 and some are left bed bound and severely handicapped. According to recent reports, 50% of hEDS patients have considered suicide due to not only chronic pain, depression and surgeries, but sadly due to physician-patient interactions being dismissive.\n\nhEDS is viewed as the most neglected disease in modern medicine. The healthcare burden is significant with annual costs estimated at \\~$100K/year/patient with a total cost of $3-10M over a lifetime per patient. Physicians are taught limited and misleading information in medical school that Ehlers Danlos Syndromes are benign and rare diseases. These education deficiencies combined with phenotype heterogeneity result in diagnostic challenges. Consequentially, the average time to diagnosis from first symptoms is 14 years. The proposed studies in this application are an important step in transforming how the disease is viewed and understood in the medical community and will provide hope to the many patients with hEDS.\n\nAs there is little known about the etiology of the multi-system dysfunction and co-morbidities in hEDS, investigators propose an exploratory study of wide breadth to search for the most promising follow-up investigations. To that end, our main goal is to establish a human trial to investigate the effect of hEDS on multiple body systems and the potentially beneficial effects of an intervention known to have effects on most of those same body systems (vagus nerve stimulation - VNS). Investigators propose to advance mechanistic understanding of hEDS and to test a new therapeutic approach.\n\nSpecific Aim: Investigate whether 4 weeks of at-home transcutaneous auricular VNS (tAN) improves a battery of nine key physical and psychological symptoms of a group of hEDS patients (n=36) using an open-label active only design. Investigators will remotely collect clinical measures at baseline, and weekly timepoints through week 4, as well as a 3 month follow up. Investigators will test patients in the following domains: pain, fatigue, sleep, anxiety, depression, quality of life, GI function, immune function and autonomic function."

Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either of 2 treatment groups as follows:\n\n* Talazoparib in combination with enzalutamide.\n* Placebo capsules identical in appearance to talazoparib capsules in combination with enzalutamide.\n\nTalazoparib or identical placebo treatment will be blinded. Enzalutamide (160 mg/day) will be open label. The dose of talazoparib/placebo to be given in combination with enzalutamide is 0.5 mg once daily. Participants with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 by the MDRD equation) at screening may be enrolled and the talazoparib/placebo dose will be 0.35 mg once daily."

Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation, small cell or signet cell features. If the participant does not have a prior histological diagnosis, a baseline de novo biopsy must be used to confirm the diagnosis and may also be used to support biomarker analysis.\n3. Confirmation of DDR gene mutation status by prospective or historical analysis (with sponsor pre-approval) of blood (liquid biopsy) and/or de novo or archival tumor tissue using FoundationOne Liquid CDx or FoundationOne CDx.\n4. Willing to provide tumor tissue when available (de novo or archived) for retrospective molecular profiling analysis, if not already provided as part of inclusion criterion 3.\n5. Unless prohibited by local regulations or ethics committee decision, consent to a saliva sample collection for retrospective sequencing of the same DDR genes tested on tumor tissue and blood (liquid biopsy), or a subset thereof, and to serve as a germline control in identifying tumor mutations.\n6. Ongoing ADT with a GnRH agonist or antagonist for participants who have not undergone bilateral orchiectomy must be initiated before randomization and must continue throughout the study.\n7. Metastatic prostate cancer documented by positive bone scan (for bone disease) or metastatic lesions on CT or MRI scan (for soft tissue). Participants whose disease spread is limited to regional pelvic lymph nodes are not eligible. Note: a finding of superscan at baseline is exclusionary.\n8. Prior treatment of mCSPC with docetaxel is not permitted.\n9. Treatment with estrogens, cyproterone acetate, or first-generation anti-androgens is allowed until randomization.\n10. Other prior therapy allowed for mCSPC; ≤3 months of ADT (chemical or surgical) with or without approved NHT in mCSPC (ie, abiraterone + prednisone, apalutamide, or enzalutamide), if required prior to randomization, with no radiographic evidence of disease progression or rising PSA levels prior to Day 1.\n11. Participant may have received palliative radiation or surgery for symptomatic control secondary to prostate cancer, which should have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to randomization. NOTE: Radical prostatectomy or definitive radiotherapy to the primary tumor for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer with curative intent is not permitted.\n12. ECOG performance status 0 or 1.\n13. Adequate organ function within 28 days before the first study treatment on Day 1, defined by the following:\n\n    * ANC ≥1500/µL, platelets ≥100,000/µL, or hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (may not have received growth factors or blood transfusions within 14 days before obtaining the hematology laboratory tests at screening).\n    * Total serum bilirubin \\<1.5 × ULN (\\<3 × ULN for participants with documented Gilbert syndrome or for whom indirect bilirubin concentrations suggest an extrahepatic source of elevation).\n    * AST or ALT \\<2.5 × ULN (\\<5 × ULN if liver function abnormalities are due to hepatic metastasis).\n    * Albumin \\>2.8 g/dL.\n    * eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 by the MDRD equation.\n14. Sexually active participants that in the opinion of the investigator are capable of ejaculating, must agree to use a condom when having sex with a partner (female or male) from the time of the first dose of study treatment through 4 months after last dose of study treatment (or, if talazoparib/placebo has been stopped more than a month earlier than enzalutamide, through 3 months after last dose of enzalutamide). Must also agree for female partner of childbearing potential to use an additional highly effective form of contraception from the time of the first dose of study treatment through 4 months after last dose of study treatment (or, if talazoparib / placebo has been stopped more than a month earlier than enzalutamide, through 3 months after last dose of enzalutamide) when having sex.\n15. Must agree not to donate sperm from the first dose of study treatment to 4 months after the last dose of study treatment (or, if talazoparib/placebo has been stopped more than a month earlier than enzalutamide, through 3 months after last dose of enzalutamide).\n16. Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures, including being able to manage electronic diaries. The PRO assessments are not required to be completed if a patient does not understand the language(s) available for a specific questionnaire and/or cannot complete the specific questionnaire independently.\n17. Capable of giving signed informed consent.\n18. For France only: Participants affiliated with the social security system or beneficiaries of an equivalent system.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Other acute or chronic medical (concurrent disease, infection, including chronic stable HIV, HBV, or HCV infection, or co-morbidity) or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that interferes with a participant's ability to participate in the study, may increase the risk of associated with study participation or study treatment administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant inappropriate for entry into the study. HIV/HBV/HCV testing is not required unless mandated by local health authority.\n2. History of seizure or any condition (as assessed by investigator) that may predispose to seizure (eg, prior cortical stroke, significant brain trauma), including any history of loss of consciousness or transient ischemic attack within 12 months of randomization.\n3. Major surgery (as defined by the investigator) within 4 weeks before randomization.\n4. Known or suspected brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease.\n5. Symptomatic or impending spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.\n6. Any history of MDS, AML, or prior malignancy except for the following:\n\n   * Carcinoma in situ or non-melanoma skin cancer.\n   * A cancer diagnosed and treated ≥3 years before randomization with no subsequent evidence of recurrence.\n   * American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage 0 or Stage 1 cancer \\<3 years before randomization that has a remote probability of recurrence in the opinion of the investigator and the sponsor.\n7. In the opinion of the investigator, any clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption.\n8. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including any of the following:\n\n   * Myocardial infarction or symptomatic cardiac ischemia within 6 months before randomization.\n   * Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association class III or IV.\n   * History of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (eg, sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsade de pointes) within 1 year before screening.\n   * History of Mobitz II second degree or third-degree heart block unless a permanent pacemaker is in place.\n   * Hypotension as indicated by systolic blood pressure \\<86 mm Hg at screening.\n   * Bradycardia as indicated by a heart rate of \\<45 beats per minute on the screening electrocardiogram.\n   * Uncontrolled hypertension as indicated by systolic blood pressure \\>170 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure \\>105 mm Hg at screening. However, participants can be rescreened after adequate control of blood pressure is achieved.\n9. Active COVID-19 infection detected by viral test or based on clinical diagnosis (as assessed by investigator). Asymptomatic participants with no active COVID-19 infection detected but positive antibody tests, indicating past infection are allowed.\n10. Prior ADT in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting, where the completion of ADT was less than 12 months prior to randomization and the total duration of ADT exceeded 36 months.\n11. Participant received treatment with systemic glucocorticoids greater than the equivalent of 10 mg per day of prednisone within 4 weeks prior to randomization, intended for the treatment of prostate cancer.\n12. Any previous treatment with DNA-damaging cytotoxic chemotherapy (ie, platinum based therapy) within 5 years prior to randomization, except for indications other than prostate cancer.\n13. Prior treatment with a PARPi, or known or possible hypersensitivity to enzalutamide, any of enzalutamide capsule excipients or to any talazoparib/placebo capsule excipients.\n14. Prior treatment in any setting with NHT, except as described in Inclusion Criterion #10.\n15. Current use of potent P-gp inhibitors within 7 days prior to randomization.\n16. Treatment with any investigational study intervention within 4 weeks before randomization. Exception: COVID-19 vaccines authorized under an emergency use authorization (or equivalent) can be administered without a washout period.\n17. Baseline 12-lead ECG that demonstrates clinically relevant abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results (eg, QTcF interval \\>470 msec, complete LBBB, signs of an acute or indeterminate age myocardial infarction, ST-T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second or third degree AV block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the baseline uncorrected QT interval is \\>470 msec, this interval should be rate-corrected using the Fridericia method and the resulting QTcF should be used for decision making and reporting. If QTc exceeds 470 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility. Computer-interpreted ECGs should be overread by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding participants.\n18. Investigator site staff or Sponsor employees directly involved in the conduct of the study, site staff otherwise supervised by the investigator, and their respective family members.\n19.

Thus we evaluate a community-based mobile phone intervention (mivacunaLA) to assess if there is an increase in vaccination rates among 12-17 year old children and willingness to vaccinate 2-11year old children who have not been previously vaccinated who reside in high-risk and low resourced neighborhoods in Los Angeles.",
          "detailedDescription": "We conducted a community-based randomized clinical trial with a wait list control group among adult Latino parents or caregivers in East and South Los Angeles. Participants completed an online demographic and baseline survey and were randomly assigned to treatment or wait-list control. Based on their preference, participants received a weekly text message or email link twice a week for four weeks (Mon and Wed at noon). Twice a week messages consisted of a short text (\\<160 characters) linking participants to a 2-3 minute video (Monday) and educational text (around 500 words in length. The material was divided into weekly topics regarding the coronavirus vaccine and other topics relevant to the Latino community. Participants were also directed to reliable websites where they could access additional information and links with instructions on where to get vaccinated. Upon completing the intervention, participants completed a 1-month follow-up survey."

          "briefSummary": "The focus of this study is to determine whether adding Whole Health Coaching (WHC) improves pain care among adults with chronic pain and who are currently working with a pain management team (PMT) at the VA.",
          "detailedDescription": "This multisite pragmatic effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 2 trial will randomize 432 patients to compare Pain Management Team - Usual Care (PMT-UC) vs. Pain Management Team Usual Care + Whole Health Coaching (PMT-WHC) on the primary composite outcome of pain-related interference and opioid safety. The investigators will also evaluate the impact of PMT-WHC on buprenorphine initiation and maintenance, evaluate implementation facilitation strategies for building and sustaining PMTs, and conduct a budget impact analysis.\n\nThe primary study goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of adding Whole Health Coaching to PMTs adhering to VA standards on the primary composite outcome of pain-related function and opioid safety, and secondary outcomes of wellbeing and physical functioning. Participants will have a 50/50 random chance of being assigned to (a) continuing to receive usual care from the PMT or (b) (a) receiving WHC in addition to the usual care provided by the PMT.\n\nBoth groups will receive usual care from the PMT, which will include a baseline evaluation with at least two PMT clinicians. Follow-up appointments will vary based on clinical judgment of the PMT members, but most patients will be followed for at least six months with at least three follow-up appointments. Both groups will complete questionnaires via telephone at (1) baseline, (2) month 1, (3) month 3, (4) month 6, and (5) month 12. The questionnaires will ask about personal characteristics and demographics, pain, physical function, ability to do activities, social support, sleep, mental health, use of medications and health services, and substance use.\n\nIf assigned to participate in PMT-WHC, participants will work with a Whole Health Coach for eight (8) individual sessions. Whole Health Coaching begins by completing a Personalized Health Inventory (PHI), where progress is assessed within eight (8) dimensions of health and wellness: Physical, Emotional, Social, Spiritual, Intellectual, Environmental, Financial, and Occupational health. The Inventory culminates in defining personal values and overall goals for health and wellness (i.e., \"What do you want your health for?\") based on a person's mission, aspiration, and purpose. This will be used to create goals that become part of a Personal Health Plan. The Personal Health Plan emphasizes self-management strategies to manage pain. After the Plan is developed, ongoing support is provided from the Coach in coaching sessions. Coaches will meet with participants on a biweekly basis for the first three (3) months after randomization and on a monthly basis for the final two (2) months, for a total of eight (8) sessions across approximately five (5) months. The sessions with the WHC will be recorded (audio recordings only, no photographs or video recordings). However, participation is still available in this study if participants decline to be recorded.\n\nParticipants may also be selected to participate in a qualitative interview. If selected, the interview covers participant experiences and opinions about working with the PMT, and, if relevant, the WHC. This interview will be recorded and will be approximately 60 minutes. Participants are not required to complete the interview and are still eligible to participate in this research study if the interview portion is declined.\n\nThe study will also evaluate implementation facilitation as a strategy to support PMTs in implementing care for patients with pain and opioid safety concerns. Implementation facilitation will include audit and feedback and other strategies tailored to each site. A budget impact analysis will monitor implementation and intervention costs."

Have a diagnosis of peripheral neuropathic pain in both feet from generalized distal sensory polyneuropathy based on the following criteria\n\n   1. A history of a relevant lesion of the peripheral nervous system, disease, toxic exposure, or no known cause (i.e., idiopathic).\n   2. Pain distribution in a neuroanatomically plausible distribution consistent with a symmetrical generalized polyneuropathy (i.e., with a \"glove and stocking\" distal to proximal gradient).\n   3. DN4 score≥ 4\n3. Have experienced the neuropathic pain in the feet for at least 6 months.\n4. Have at least one of the following sensory signs upon clinical examination: abnormal pinprick perception, allodynia, hyperalgesia, abnormal light touch perception, abnormal vibratory perception, or abnormal proprioception.\n5. Have average daily baseline worst pain intensity in their feet of 4 or greater and less than 10, on a 0-10 numeric rating scale of pain intensity (0 = \"no pain,\" 10= \"most intense pain imaginable\") as measured on the daily diary during screening from at least 5 measurements.\n6. Able to understand and read English. This requirement is to ensure that participants can provide informed consent and complete PROs.\n7. Have been on stable dosages of all pain medications or using all non-pharmacologic treatments for neuropathy pain at consistent frequency for at least 1 month and willing and able to stay on those dosages (or use those frequencies) (except acetaminophen rescue) throughout the duration of the study.\n8. Willing and able to complete electronic patient-reported outcomes at home using a REDCap link.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Exclusion criteria 10, 13, 14, 20 pertain only to trial protocols that include duloxetine.\n\n  * Exclusion criterion 11, 19 pertain only to trial protocols that include pregabalin.\n\n    1. Taking any opioid medication with a daily mean morphine equivalent (MME) of \\> 30.\n    2. Have a different diagnosis of pain in the feet including but not limited to musculoskeletal pain (e.g., foot arthritis, plantar fasciitis) or lumbar sacral radiculopathy that they rate to be worse than their neuropathic pain in their feet, or that in the opinion of the investigator, precludes the participant from rating their neuropathy pain in their feet.\n    3. Have a central cause of neuropathic pain (e.g., demyelinating disease, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease).\n    4. Have a history of an inciting traumatic or surgical cause that corresponds with the development of features consistent with a peripheral neuropathy.\n    5. Bilateral polyradiculopathy, with a distal distribution (i.e., symptoms extending into the feet).\n    6. History of acute polyneuropathy (e.g., Guillain-Barre Syndrome, acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy \\[AMSAN\\]) within 6 months prior to Visit 1.\n    7. Have autoimmune-mediated neuropathy (e.g., RA, lupus, Sjogren syndrome, Lyme disease, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)) unless the associated inflammation is controlled and, in the opinion of the investigator, is expected to remain stable throughout the course of the study.\n    8. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in which nociceptive pain from joint deformity confounds assessment of neuropathic pain.\n    9. Have taken the treatment that caused the participant's neuropathy (e.g., neurotoxic chemotherapy, certain HIV therapies) less than 6 months prior to Visit 1.\n    10. Have taken duloxetine (at least 60mg/day) in the past 6 months or have taken duloxetine at any dosage within a week prior to the screening visit.\\*\\*\n    11. Have taken pregabalin (at least 300mg/day) OR gabapentin (at least 1200mg/day) in the past 6 months or have taken pregabalin or gabapentin at any dosage within a week prior to the screening visit.##\n    12. Have ever previously taken BOTH pregabalin (or gabapentin) AND duloxetine at sufficient dosages and for a sufficient length of time that, in the opinion of the investigator, the participant should have experienced pain relief if they were going to respond, but they did not receive benefit from EITHER drug.\n    13. Taking venlafaxine, buproprion, tramadol, or St. John's Wort. Concomitant use of one medication that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin is allowed at certain dosages. (See Appendix A for maximum allowed dosages for common selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs); maximum dosages for other applicable drugs will be decided by the research team leadership composed of a) clinical pharmacist with extensive experience in chronic pain management, b) a physician board-certified in pain medicine and psychiatry, and c) a board-certified neurologist.\\*\\*\n    14.

          "briefSummary": "Patients diagnosed with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), a rare type of tumor in the digestive tractparticipate in this scientific research study, known as a registry study, to help improve understanding and treatment of GIST.\n\nThis study collects medical information and biological samples-such as blood or tumor tissue-from patients. It does not involve new treatments, medications, or medical procedures. The patient's regular medical care will continue as usual, and participation will not require extra appointments or tests.\n\nThe study aims to learn more about how GIST behaves, especially in rare forms such as SDH-deficient or NF1-associated tumors. While targeted drugs are available for many patients, some tumors return or become resistant to treatment. By gathering data from many patients, researchers hope to better understand these challenges, identify risk factors for worse outcomes, and help design future studies and treatments-especially for rare types of GIST.\n\nIf the patient agrees to participate, information will be collected from their medical records, scans (such as CT or MRI), and doctor visits. They may be asked to complete optional questionnaires about their health and quality of life. If they consent, small blood samples (up to 50 ml) may be collected during routine check-ups. If surgery is needed, a small part of the tumor tissue may be stored for research. Other samples-such as saliva, stool, urine, or spinal fluid-may also be collected if they are taken during normal care, to study how bacteria in the body might affect the disease and treatment.\n\nParticipation is completely voluntary. The patient can choose to join or not, and can withdraw at any time without affecting their care or relationship with their doctor. Even if they do not agree to provide biological samples, they can still take part in the study by sharing medical data and scan results.",
          "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, multi-center observational study aiming to collect clinical data from GIST patients and to longitudinally store radiological and pathological material. Additionally, anonymized retrospective data from the period 1995 to 2025 will be supplemented from existing institutional GIST databases. The study does not currently aim to change current clinical practice in treating GIST patients. Instead, it seeks to generate a robust and consistent dataset to capture oncological outcomes, as well as other outcomes that may improve the quality of care (e.g., surgical results, patient and disease-related risk factors, healthcare research), ultimately enhancing the treatment and counseling of GIST patients.\n\nPatients diagnosed with GIST who meet the inclusion criteria are invited to participate in the current study. Eligible patients receive comprehensive information about the proposed treatment, as well as details on the data and materials (clinical, radiological, and pathological) that will be collected. They are informed that participation will not affect their current treatment. Suitable and informed patients who provide consent are enrolled in the prospective cohort study (PCS) and followed prospectively.\n\nFor patients who voluntarily consent to sample collection through the West German Biobank Essen or the externa biobank of üparticipating centers, additional blood samples are collected during planned CT scans of the chest and abdomen-alongside routine blood draws-for storage in the biobank. Patients are also invited to complete optional questionnaires about their quality of life. If a tumor resection is performed, tumor tissue may be stored for research purposes upon consent. If patients choose to continue treatment or follow-up at another center, they may be contacted by phone at regular intervals after giving consent, and asked to complete quality-of-life questionnaires. They may also be asked to share imaging data and medical reports. With consent, the study team will contact the treating physicians to obtain updates on the patient's disease course.\n\nA data collection form has been developed in the REDCap platform at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (IKIM), Essen, Germany. It includes patient- and tumor-related factors, treatment variables, follow-up findings, time to local recurrence, and follow-up status. All participating centers use this shared platform. Retrospective data are stored anonymously, while prospective data are stored pseudonymously. Only the overall study leadership has access to all data.\n\nEach participating reference center can access imaging data (CT or MRI scans) and pathological material (a representative formalin-fixed tumor block) from their own patients. Patient identifiers are removed to ensure confidentiality. All data shared between institutions are de-identified and pseudonymized, and all measures to conceal patient identities are taken. Radiological images are also pseudonymized and stored in the REDCap database. Pathological materials are stored in a decentralized manner within the biobanks of the participating centers. Consent to participate in the biobank is optional.\n\nAfter a subproject is submitted and approved, pseudonymized data are made available to the respective centers. Each center is responsible for entering and storing its own patient data, imaging results, and pathological samples. At the time of analysis, each center is required to provide updated data upon request.\n\nPersonal data are retained only for as long as necessary for study purposes. Data will be deleted no later than 30 years after enrollment. Personal data are only shared with third parties if consent has been given or if a law permits such sharing.\n\nWithin the GISTT Research Consortium, anonymized data may be shared upon request with participating centers in Germany and abroad (within and outside Europe), provided a project proposal has been submitted to the overall study leadership and the research question is deemed meaningful and feasible. It is expected that additional centers will join the study over time. All participating centers may submit project proposals. These centers are typically research-focused sarcoma centers at university hospitals worldwide. Data are shared exclusively in pseudonymized form. The distribution of biological samples is also coordinated through the overall study leadership."

In physiotherapy training, particularly in technically complex subjects like electrotherapy, conventional instruction may fall short in fostering active learning and knowledge retention. Game-based platforms such as Ren'Py offer an opportunity to integrate interactive, scenario-based learning into the curriculum. This study aimed to assess the impact of Ren'Py-based digital materials on learning outcomes by comparing conventional, digital, and hybrid teaching models in an undergraduate electrotherapy course."

          "briefSummary": "Researchers are looking for new ways to treat children with hepatoblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) that has relapsed or is refractory:\n\n* Hepatoblastoma is a common liver cancer in babies and very young children\n* RMS is a cancer that starts in muscle cells, often in a child's head and neck, bladder, arms, or legs\n* Relapsed means the cancer came back after treatment\n* Refractory means the cancer did not respond (get smaller or go away) to treatment\n\nThe study treatment HER3-DXd (also known as MK-1022 or patritumab deruxtecan) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). An ADC attaches to a protein on cancer cells and delivers treatment to destroy those cells. The goals of this study are to learn:\n\n* About the safety of HER3-DXd in children and if they tolerate it\n* What happens to HER3-DXd in children's bodies over time\n* If children who receive HER3-DXd have the cancer get smaller or go away",
          "detailedDescription": "This study will have 2 parts: a safety lead-in to demonstrate a tolerable safety profile and confirm a preliminary recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) (Part 1) followed by an efficacy evaluation (Part 2)."

          "briefSummary": "This is a pilot trial to examine the feasibility and preliminary effect of a multilevel intervention 'Nudges to Quit' on smoking cessation in patients with serious mental illness who smoke in a community mental health center (CMHC). \"Nudges to Quit\" is a multilevel intervention to increate engagement of patient, case worker, and pharmacist with tobacco treatment. The pilot trial is to generate the needed evidence for designing a future large trial to evaluate the effect of 'Nudges to Quit' as a multilevel intervention to increase tobacco treatment and reduce tobacco use among patients with serious mental illness.",
          "detailedDescription": "The overarching goal of this pilot project is to reduce the disparity in the treatment of tobacco use among individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) with low burden, multi-level implementation strategies, an important need reflected in existing evidence and a recent survey of community needs. Individuals with SMI have a much higher smoking prevalence (60% vs. 15%) and die 25 years earlier compared to the general population. Despite the fact that SMI patients express interest in and have success with evidence-based smoking cessation treatment, inadequate provision of treatment in community mental health centers (CMHCs) contributes to the high smoking prevalence and related health consequences among the mentally ill. The pilot trial aims to understand the feasibility and preliminary effects of a multilevel intervention \"Nudges to Quit,\" designed to increase patient, case worker, and pharmacist engagement with tobacco treatment in a community mental health clinic setting. Therefore, the investigators propose a pilot randomized trial of 60 patients. Patients will be randomized with 1:1 allocation to usual care vs. intervention \"Nudges to Quit\". All patients will receive pre-appointment tobacco treatment needs assessment (t1) with patient input as decision support for their care team. For patients in the intervention arm, their care team (case worker and pharmacist) will receive nudge reminders based on patient-reported tobacco treatment need assessment to offer tobacco treatment. For patients in the usual care arm, the team will proceed with usual care and receive the intervention at 3 months post-enrollment (t2) to ensure all participants will receive benefit from the intervention with variation in timing. All patients will receive a baseline (t1), 3 month (t2), and 6 month follow-up survey (t3). In Aim 1, the investigators will test the effect of nudges on patient receipt of tobacco treatment. The investigators hypothesize patient receipt of tobacco cessation treatment such as medication and counseling will be higher after delivery of nudges over usual care. In Aim 2, the investigators will test the effect of nudges on smoking behaviors. The investigators hypothesize smoking behaviors will be positively effected in the nudges to quit group compared to usual care. In Aim 3, the investigators will evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effect of this pilot project for a future R01 proposal to systematically evaluate this multilevel intervention adapted for CMHCs."

Following exercise, blood flow remains elevated and seems to be the reason for many of the positive cardiovascular benefits that occur with exercise. When the actions of histamine, a molecule primarily known for its role in allergies, are blocked, there is an attenuated blood flow response following exercise. However, this effect has never been studied in the blood vessels that supply our lungs. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of histamines on pulmonary hemodynamics following exercise."

The purpose of this study is to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of ABBV-711 as a monotherapy and in combination with budigalimab (ABBV-181) in adults with advanced squamous tumors.\n\nABBV-711 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of solid tumors. There are multiple treatment arms in this study. Participants will either receive ABBV-711 as a single agent or in combination with budigalimab (another investigational drug) at different doses. Approximately 220 adult participants will be enrolled in the study across 40 sites worldwide.\n\nIn part 1, oral ABBV-711 tablets will be given in escalating doses alone to participants with squamous (sq) tumors. In part 2 oral ABBV-711 tablets will be given at a selected dose from part 1 to participants with squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sqNSCLC), or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In part 3, oral ABBV-711 tablets will be given in escalating doses in combination with intravenously (IV) infused budigalimab to participants with sq tumors. In part 4 oral ABBV-711 tablets will be given at a selected dose from part 3 in combination with IV infused budigalimab to participants with sqNSCLC, or HNSCC. The estimated duration of the study is up to approximately 5 years.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic and may require frequent questionnaire, medical assessments, blood tests, and scans."

          "briefSummary": "Many people living with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience pain. However, pain is sometimes unrecognized and under-managed in people with CF. Both medication and non-medication interventions can be used to treat pain and ideally, there is a multicomponent management approach.\n\nThe goal of this study is to pilot a new 3-session non-medication mind-body pain management intervention specifically designed for adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). The intervention is titled Pain Acknowledgement Coping and Empowerment in CF (PACE CF).\n\nPACE CF will be administered by a member of the CF care team via telehealth visits to participants at home or during a hospitalization.\n\nThe aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and patient acceptability of the intervention as well as preliminary evidence of the impact of the intervention on pain and its interference in daily life.\n\nThe study will also examine outcomes such as perceived coping, quality of life, symptoms of depression or anxiety, and use of prescribed pain medication, in an exploratory manner.",
          "detailedDescription": "This study is a multi-center collaboration of a psychological approach to pain treatment in CF. This is the first study to elicit input from the CF community and CF care team members to develop a brief, focused psychological treatment for pain in adults with CF (MGB IRB exempt protocol# 2022P003370). Utilizing the development phase of the grant (protocol# 2022P003370), the investigators developed a brief (3-session) structured intervention manual and patient workbook based on CF community feedback (PACE CF). The intervention will be highly accessible, delivered by a member of the CF care team via telehealth in both inpatient and outpatient settings. The workbook will provide education and resources for patients and reinforce skill practice. Resources will facilitate future training and dissemination, standardization, and evaluation of feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of the intervention in a larger trial.\n\nThe PACE CF intervention integrates the well-established science of behavioral pain management with CF-specific content drawn from feedback from community stakeholders to develop an intervention specific to pain in CF. The investigators anticipate that integration of this intervention into the existing CF model of care will positively impact people with CF by increasing access to best practices in pain treatment, while minimizing additional cost and burden of care."

At the two week follow-up, sutures will be removed and another small biopsy of soft tissue will be taken. Subjects will be seen again at 3 months for a final collection of clinical data and radiographs.",

Prior to extraction, a limited-view cone beam computed tomography radiograph will be taken as well as clinical measures of periodontal inflammation (probing depths, recession, bleeding on probing, gingival crevicular fluid sampling). The extraction will be completed atraumatically and with local anesthesia. Following extraction, a small biopsy of the soft tissue of the extraction site will be taken and the site then sutured. At the two-week postoperative visit, sutures will be removed and another soft tissue biopsy of the healing site will be collected (along with clinical data from the adjacent teeth). The soft tissue biopsies will be fixed and processed for inflammatory endocytes present during wound healing. At the three-month postoperative visit, all clinical parameters of wound healing will be evaluated; including inflammatory measures (probing depths, recession, bleeding on probing, gingival crevicular fluid sampling) from the adjacent teeth; as well as a limited-view cone beam computed tomography radiograph.\n\nThe biopsies will be processed to obtain single cell counts with half of the preparation stained and analyzed via multiparameter flow cytometry. The other half of single cells obtained from the tissue biopsies will be cryopreserved for cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes-sequencing."

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to understand how the blood sugar-lowering hormone insulin works in healthy adults versus those who are at risk for type 2 diabetes. The study will use a drug called alpelisib, which interferes with insulin's actions in the body, to answer the study's main question: does the liver continue to respond to insulin's stimulation of fat production even when it loses the ability to stop making glucose (sugar) in response to insulin. Researchers will compare the impact of single doses of both alpelisib and placebo (inert non-drug) in random order (like flipping a coin) in study participants. Participants will be asked to stay twice overnight in the hospital, take single doses of alpelisib and placebo (one or the other on each of the two hospital stays), and receive intravenous (into the vein) infusions of non-radioactive \"tracer\" molecules that allow researchers to measure the production of glucose (sugar) and fats by the liver. Measurements will be done both overnight, while participants are asleep and fasting (not eating or drinking other than water) and while consuming a standardized diet of nutritional beverages during the following day.\n\nThe objective is to evaluate the effect of lowering insulin levels, while maintaining constant mild hyperglycemia, on plasma glucose and lipid levels.",
          "detailedDescription": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is an under-appreciated complication of lipid dysmetabolism in type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Although it appears that insulin resistance (IR) is a mechanism common to both, the mechanisms linking IR to unhealthy fat accumulation in liver remains unclear. \"Pure\" IR would be expected to disinhibit hepatic glucose production while dampening hepatic triglyceride (TG) biosynthesis, but the excessive hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) of IR-associated MASLD suggests that hepatic IR is \"selective.\" However, the concept of IR selectivity is controversial, and because of clinical heterogeneity, lead-time discrepancies, co-morbidities, and medication effects, parsing out this pathophysiologic conundrum in humans is challenging. The investigators plan to test whether the multifactorial IR in patients at risk of T2DM/MASLD is selective by determining if inducing a discrete, \"pure\" form of IR, via pharmacologic inhibition of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) with alpelisib, versus placebo, attenuates excessive DNL. Investigators will also study this question in healthy, insulin-sensitive (IS) volunteers.\n\nParticipants in this randomized crossover trial will be admitted twice to the inpatient clinical research unit. During each admission, they will take a dose of either alpelisib or placebo (in randomized order) in the evening and receive infusions of \\[13C\\] sodium acetate and \\[2H\\] D-glucose to measure DNL and endogenous glucose production (EGP), respectively, during an overnight fast. DNL measurement will then continue during the following day during 8 hours of standardized mixed-meal feedings. Blood will be drawn at defined intervals for determining levels of glucose, insulin, lipids including triglycerides and free fatty acids, and tracer/tracee enrichments for the stable-isotope tracers. There will be a 2-8-week hiatus for drug washout between the two inpatient study admissions."

Build a prospective cohort of patients to study HPT-associated end-organ damage.\n2. Determine end-organ physiologic consequences of HPT.\n3. Elucidate determinants of HPT-associated end-organ damage.\n\nFunding Source - FDA OOPD",
          "detailedDescription": "The goal of this study is to prospectively collect data on the natural history of hypoparathyroidism (HPT). This will enable longitudinal data collection of complications in this disease, specifically defining the epidemiology of end-organ complications of HPT that are related to high calcification propensity. It will also determine relationships between calcification burden and end-organ disease severity and progression risk and assess the utility of traditional and novel biomarkers of mineral and bone metabolism on disease diagnosis and monitoring. These data will inform future investigations on the development, study, and implementation of HPT end-organ disease modifying strategies and impact clinical practice in hypoparathyroidism."

The patient and/or his/her legal representative must read, sign and date the Informed Consent document before any study-related procedures are performed. The Informed Consent form signed by patients and/or legal representatives must have been approved by the IRB for the current study.\n* Patients must have the ability and willingness to comply with study procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nVisual Acuity:\n\n* Best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) score better than 75 ETDRS letters, or 0.2 LogMAR, or 20/32 Snellen or 0.625 decimal fraction in the affected eye\n\nOcular Health:\n\n* Ocular drug toxicity less than two weeks ago\n* Any active ocular infection (bacterial, viral, fungal or protozoal) or active ocular inflammation in the affected eye.\n* History of any ocular surgery (including laser or refractive surgical procedures) in the affected eye within the three months before study enrollment. (An exception to the preceding statement will be allowed if the ocular surgery is considered to be the cause of the PED. Ocular surgery in the affected eye will not be allowed during the study treatment period and elective ocular surgery procedures should not be planned during the duration of the follow-up period unless the patient will be involved in corneal thinning of more than 1/3 corneal stroma, corneal melting or perforation.\n* Prior surgical procedure(s) for the treatment of a chronic corneal epitheliopathy (e.g., complete tarsorrhaphy, conjunctival flap, etc.) in the affected eye with the exception of amniotic membrane transplantation. Patients previously treated with amniotic membrane transplantation may only be enrolled two weeks after the membrane has disappeared within the area of the chronic corneal epitheliopathy or corneal ulcer or at least six weeks after the date of the amniotic membrane transplantation procedure. Patients previously treated with Botox (botulinum toxin) injections used to induce pharmacologic blepharoptosis are eligible for enrollment only if the last injection was given at least 90 days prior to enrollment in the study.\n* Chronic corneal epitheliopathy in the background of endothelial decompensation that needs corneal graft\n* Anticipated need for punctual occlusion during the study treatment period. Patients with punctual occlusion or punctual plugs inserted prior to the study are eligible for enrollment provided that the punctual occlusion is maintained during the study.\n* Evidence of corneal ulceration involving the posterior third of the corneal stroma, corneal melting or perforation in the affected eye.\n* Presence or history of any ocular or systemic disorder or condition that might hinder the efficacy of the study treatment or its evaluation, could possibly interfere with the interpretation of study results, or could be judged by the investigator to be incompatible with the study visit schedule or conduct (e.g., progressive or degenerative corneal or retinal conditions, uveitis, optic neuritis, poorly controlled diabetes, autoimmune disease, systemic infection, neoplastic diseases).\n* Patients with uncontrolled eyelid abnormality that preclude appropriate eyelid closure or including eyelash abnormality\n\nStudy Procedures:\n\n* Known hypersensitivity to one of the components of the study or procedural medications (e.g., fluorescein).\n* History of drug, medication or alcohol abuse or addiction.\n* Use of any investigational agent within 4 weeks of screening visit.\n* Participation in another clinical study at the same time as the present study.\n* Participants who are pregnant at the time of study enrollment will be excluded; pregnancy is identified according to the patient's self-report /positive βhCG",

The study will also determine the prevalence rate of estrogen receptor α (ESR1) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) mutations in the study population.\n\nThe secondary objectives include evaluating the progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with and without ESR1 mutations, and PI3K mutations through analysis of tumor biopsies and circulating plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA) samples. The study will also describe other alterations in genes and gene products relevant to the cell cycle, drug targets, tumor sensitivity and resistance, and identify novel protein kinases activated in biopsies from participants with hormone refractory MBC who progressed on prior palbociclib and AI. The data will be correlated with tumor subtypes, expression profiles, and candidate phosphoprotein expression with PFS in the study population."

To estimate overall survival in patients with recurrent ovarian clear cell carcinoma being treated with LB-100 and dostarlimab, including specific survival probabilities at 6 and 12 months.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To describe clinically significant and immune related adverse events (ir-AEs) in the study population.\n2. To determine the objective response rate (ORR), time to initial response, progression free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DOR) using modified RECIST v1.1 criteria.\n\n   a. Although the clinical benefit of these drugs has not yet been established, the intent of offering this treatment is to provide a possible therapeutic benefit, and thus the patient will be carefully monitored for tumor response and symptom relief in addition to safety and tolerability.\n3. Translational:\n\n   1. To describe PP2A activity and immune changes, using baseline and on-treatment tumor biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)\n   2. To describe expression of mismatch repair proteins using immunohistochemistry (IHC)\n   3. To correlate circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels with response by modified RECIST v1.1 criteria."

          "briefSummary": "This study is being done to see if the investigators can improve the outcome of patients with biliary tract cancer that do not qualify for surgery. This study will compare the effects, good and/or bad, of using a combination of standard of care chemoimmunotherapy, with the addition of radiation and deep hyperthermia. In this study, participants will be receiving standard of care chemoimmunotherapy (gemcitabine, cisplatin, and durvalumab), radiation (spatially fractionated radiation therapy), and deep hyperthermia.\n\nChemoimmunotherapy Chemoimmunotherapy is when chemotherapy drugs are combined with immunotherapy drugs. Chemotherapy uses different drugs to kill or slow the growth of cancer cells, whereas immunotherapy drugs are used to help the immune system attack cancer cells. For this study, the drugs Gemcitabine, Cisplatin, and Durvalumab will be used. Chemoimmunotherapy will be delivered over 4 cycles for this study and can continue longer if the treating physician decides this is appropriate. Each cycle will last 3 weeks.\n\nSpatially fractionated radiation therapy (SFRT) SFRT is a form of radiation therapy that gives a single large dose of radiation to large tumors or tumors that do not qualify for surgery. This is not a standard type of treatment for people with this diagnosis. For this study, participants will be receiving radiation once on day 1 of the second chemoimmunotherapy cycle.\n\nDeep Hyperthermia (HT) Hyperthermia is used in combination with chemoimmunotherapy and radiation treatment in this study. Hyperthermia has the potential to make both chemotherapy and radiation treatments more effective. For this study, participants will receive HT three times: on the first day of cycles 2, 3, and 4 of chemoimmunotherapy."

LV end-diastolic diameter ≥55 mm measured by TTE and assessed by an echo core lab\n4. Symptom Status:\n\n   1. NYHA III,\n   2. NYHA ambulatory IV, or\n   3. NYHA II with a heart failure hospitalization within the prior 12 months (of signing the consent)\n5. Able to complete six-minute walk test with distance between 100 m and 450 m.\n6. Diagnosis and treatment for heart failure should be established at least 90 days before the date of consent. Subjects should be on stable, optimally titrated medical therapy for at least 30 days, as recommended according to current guidelines as standard-of-care for Heart Failure therapy, with any intolerance documented.\n\n   1. \"Stable\" is defined as no more than a 100% increase or a 50% decrease of total daily doses. Medication changes within this range do not require any additional waiting before the screening assessments\n   2. When a total daily dose increase or decrease exceeds that which is considered stable, the screening TTE and CT will be postponed 30 days after the medication change\n   3. When additional titration is required to optimize a subject's medication that exceeds what is considered stable, the screening TTE and CT will be postponed at least 30 days after achieving the optimal dose (provided the optimal dose remains outside of the stable parameters)\n   4. When a dose-for-dose equivalent change in the class of medication change is made, no additional waiting is required before the screening assessments\n   5. When a change in class medication change exceeds what is considered stable, OR a new class of medication is added, the screening TTE and CT will be postponed 30 days after the medication change\n   6. If an SGLT2 inhibitor is added to a subject's medications, the screening TTE and CT will be postponed at least 30 days after the addition\n   7. If an SGLT2 inhibitor dose changes per the stable definition above, no additional waiting is required before the screening assessments\n   8. If an SGLT2 inhibitor dose change exceeds what is considered stable, the screening TTE and CT will be postponed at least 30 days after achieving the optimal dose (provided the dose remains outside of the stable parameters)\n   9. When applicable, for guideline-directed device-based therapies: a CRT device must be placed \\> 90 days before the screening TTE and CT, and an ICD must be placed \\> 30 days before the screening TTE and CT\n7. Able and willing to complete all qualifying diagnostic and functional tests, willing to accept blood product transfusion if required and agrees to comply with study follow-up schedule\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nCardiovascular\n\n1.

Suboptimal ventricular anatomy or wall thickness as determined from screening echocardiography and/or CT scan\n5. Heart failure on the basis other than ischemic or non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, amyloid cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, uncorrected congenital heart disease, constrictive pericarditis)\n6. Hemodynamic instability within 30 days prior to the implant defined as subject requiring inotropic support or mechanical hemodynamic support\n7. Any planned cardiac surgery or interventions within the next 180 days post-randomization (including therapeutic right heart procedures)\n8. Active bacterial endocarditis\n9. Severe RV dysfunction assessed by right heart catheterization (RHC) and/or TTE\n10. Fixed pulmonary hypertension with PA systolic pressure \\>70 mmHg not responsive to vasodilator therapy\n11.

          "detailedDescription": "Lower Crossed Syndrome is one of common postural disorder which occurs due to the muscular imbalance. It refers to specific altered muscle activation and movement patterns along with some postural deviations. Alterations in muscle activation include overactivity of hip flexors and lower back muscles paired underactivity of abdominals and gluteus muscle. This pattern of imbalance creates dysfunction. Postural correction exercise with inner and outer core muscles are necessary. There are different traditional structural approach, functional approach and biomechanics and are presumed to lead to adjustments in the length and strength of local muscles while ignoring other related malalignments and core stability. The objective of the study will be to determine the effects of Sequential Core Stability Corrective Exercise Approach for Alignment and Muscle Function in Lower Crossed Syndrome.\n\nIt will be a randomized controlled trial. Sample size will be collected after running the pilot study. The participants will be recruited through convenient sampling technique and then allocated randomly to Groups. Outcome measures will be alignment and muscle function. Pre and post reading and after one month follow-up will be recorded. Data will be analyzed using statistical package for social sciences software version 25. After assessing normality of data by Shapiro-Wilk test, it will be decided either parametric or nonparametric test will be use within a group or between two groups.\n\nKeywords: Alignment, Core Stability, Diaphragm, Muscular Imbalance, Muscle thickness Pelvic floor."

          "briefSummary": "This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of physiotherapy treatment combined with functional electrical stimulation (FES) in a small group of patients with severe acquired brain injury (SABI) of vascular origin and with a clinical and instrumental diagnosis of \"Intensive Care Unit-Acquired Weakness\" (ICU-AW). Functional electrical stimulation is a technology that uses electrical impulses, generated by an external device, to reactivate the neuromuscular system through electrodes applied to the skin. In functional electrical stimulation, this process is integrated into physiotherapy sessions, with the active involvement of the patient, through the performance of exercises with the assistance and supervision of the physiotherapist. The rationale behind this is to stimulate neuroplasticity processes by facilitating movement through the application of electrical stimuli and the active participation of the patient in performing a motor task, in an attempt to promote improvement in an impaired function.\n\nIn particular, the objectives that will be pursued are: improvement of lower limb neuromyopathy assessed clinically using the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, the Fugl-Meyer scale for lower limbs, the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) scale, the assessment of active and passive Range Of Motion (ROM) of the main joints of the lower limb (hip, knee, ankle) and measured instrumentally by neurophysiological examination and ultrasound examination.\n\nAfter randomization, patients in the control arm will be treated with physiotherapy and speech therapy sessions as per the conventional protocol, and an additional 15 physiotherapy sessions lasting 60 minutes over a period of 5 weeks. Alternatively, patients in the experimental group will receive, in addition to conventional rehabilitation treatment, a treatment consisting of 15 physiotherapy sessions combined with FES lasting 60 minutes over a period of 5 weeks.\n\nAt the end of the treatment period, baseline characteristics and clinical and instrumental outcome variables will be compared between the two groups using the chi-square test for dichotomous and categorical variables and the t-test for independent samples or the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables, depending on whether or not they are normally distributed. In all analyses, a p-value \\<0.05 will be considered significant."

Secondary outcomes will include renal function parameters, qSOFA scores, and the incidence of postoperative complications within the first 72 hours following surgery.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Does the choice of fluid produce different outcomes in this patient population?\n2. If yes, then which fluid produces better outcomes?\n\nEnrolled patients will be randomly assigned Ringer's Lactate or Sterofundin for intravenous infusion. The volume, infusion rate and additive content will be determined by the treating clinicians. The intervention will last for 72 hours after patients' enrolment."

          "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nClinical Genetics Branch (CGB) researchers study individuals and populations at high genetic risk of cancer in order to improve our understanding of cancer and to improve cancer care. There are currently 6 open clinical genetics studies at the CGB eligible for this screening process.\n\n* 02C0052: Etiologic Investigation of Cancer Susceptibility in Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes: A Natural History Study (Cancer in Bone Marrow Failure)\n* 11C0255: Clinical, Epidemiologic, and Genetic Studies of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (Li Fraumeni Syndrome Study)\n* 11C0034: DICER1-Related Pleuropulmonary Blastoma Cancer Predisposition Syndrome: A Natural History Study (Pleuropulmonary Blastoma)\n* 02C0211: Clinical, Laboratory, and Epidemiologic Characterization of Individuals and Families at High Risk of Melanoma (Melanoma-Prone Families)\n* 10CN188: Genetic Clues to Chordoma Etiology: A Protocol to Identify Sporadic Chordoma Patients for Studies of Cancer-susceptibility Genes (Sporadic Chordoma Study)\n\nThe following studies have their own study-specific screeners. If you are interested in these studies, please click the links below to fill out the relevant study screener:\n\n* 001109: Defining the Natural History of Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Fanconi anemia (SCC Screening in FA): https://service.cancer.gov/fanconi\n* 20C0107: Clinical, Genetic, and Epidemiologic Study of Children and Adults with RASopathies (RASopathies Study): https://service.cancer.gov/myras\n\nObjective:\n\nTo find people to participate in active CGB cancer research studies.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople of any age who meet the eligibility criteria for one of the open CGB cancer research studies. You can learn more about the CGB cancer research studies by clicking on the links to the study-specific websites above. This typically involves a personal or family history of certain cancers that are being studied by researchers at CGB.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will fill out a screening questionnaire to determine if they are eligible to participate in one or more CGB clinical genetics studies. The survey asks about personal health history, including cancer; family history; and genetic testing results and takes 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nEach study has its own eligibility criteria. Survey respondents will select which study (or studies) that are interested in participating in, and the relevant study team(s) will review the screener to determine eligibility to participate in the study. Participants who are determined to be eligible for a study based on their screener will be contacted by the respective study team to learn more about the study and to consent to enroll in the study if they choose to do so. Participants who consent to enroll in a study may be asked to provide medical records; samples such as blood, saliva, or other tissues; and to participate in activities such as phone interviews or surveys. They may be invited for evaluations at the clinical center. Every study activity is voluntary. None of the studies provide treatments. Participants may be contacted to consider enrolling in future studies.",
          "detailedDescription": "Study Description:\n\nThis protocol will be utilized for the creation and management of an eligibility screening survey for patients who are interested in enrolling in a study being conducted by the Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB).\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe primary objective of this protocol is to establish a database of eligibility data collected from prospective participants who have completed an eligibility screening survey. This database, managed by the CGB, will serve as a critical resource for assessing participant eligibility for enrollment in various CGB studies."

          "eligibilityCriteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA\n\nThere is no age restriction; therefore, viable neonates may be included. This eligibility screening protocol is intended for individuals meeting one or more of the following criteria:\n\n1. Personal or family history of a diagnosis of a syndrome being actively investigated in one of the following CGB study protocol:\n\n   * Protocol 000678: Medical history of neoplasia of an unusual type, pattern, or number.\n   * Protocol 11C0255: A personal history of adrenal cortical carcinoma or choroid plexus carcinoma at any age, regardless of family history, or family or personal medical history of neoplasia consistent with the diagnosis of LFS or LFL.\n   * Protocol 20C0107: Individuals with a clinical diagnosis of a RASopathy, including Costello syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, Legius syndrome, capillary arteriovenous malformation syndrome, or others, are eligible. Published clinical diagnostic criteria exist for most of the clinical RASopathy syndromes and differ by syndrome. It will be uncommon for individuals to have a clinical diagnosis and not have had molecular genetic testing. All individuals considered by the study team to be at risk for a RASopathy who have not had prior genetic testing will have this completed as part of the study. The rare individuals with a clinical diagnosis of a RASopathy who are not found to carry a corresponding pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in a known RASopathy gene will be considered for exome analysis for identification of potentially novel RASopathy germline variation.\n   * Protocol 11C0034: An individual with histologically-confirmed PPB and/or other DICER1-related tumors\n   * Protocol 02C0052: The participants will be affected by an IBMFS, or be members of a family with an IBMFS, and be at risk of being affected or carriers of the syndrome. Except for the rare X-linked recessive disorder (e.g. some dyskeratosis congenita patients), there should be equal numbers of male and female probands and family members. These IBMFS have been reported in most racial and ethnic groups, and thus all such groups will be included. The age range will be from birth to old age (grandparents of probands). The majority of the probands will be children (10-20% will be adults), and their parents and grandparents will be adults. All racial/ethnic groups are eligible.\n   * Protocol 02C0211: Personal medical history of melanoma of an unusual type, pattern, or number diagnosed at any age.\n   * Protocol 78C0039: Family or personal medical history of neoplasia of an unusual type, pattern, or number\n2. Personal or family history of medical condition, malignancy, and/or benign neoplasm suggestive of hereditary cancer predisposition being actively investigated in the following CGB study protocol:\n\n   * Protocol 000678: Known or suspected factor(s) predisposing to neoplasia, either genetic and/or congenital factors (birth defects, metabolic phenotype, chromosomal anomalies or Mendelian traits associated with tumors), environmental exposure (medications, occupation, radiation, diet, infectious agents, etc.), or unusual demographic features (very young age of onset, multiple tumors, etc.)\n   * Protocol 11C0255: An individual with a sarcoma diagnosed under the age of 45; AND - At least one first-degree relative (parents, brothers, sisters and children) with a cancer of any kind diagnosed under the age of 45; AND - A third family member who is either a first- or second-degree relative (such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren) with cancer diagnosed under the age of 45 or having a sarcoma at any age.\n   * Protocol 001109: On referral, persons \\>= 12 years with Fanconi Anemia (FA) primarily from North America will be included. An individual with FA who is 8 -11 years can also be included if they have a history of persistent oral potentially malignant lesion (OPMLs), dysphagia, or other concerning symptoms. Individuals with prior cancer diagnosis are eligible.\n   * Protocol 11C0034: An individual from the general population with one or more of the unique tumors of the types associated with DICER1 including (but not exclusively), PPB, cystic nephroma, ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell and other sex cordstromal tumors, ocular medulloepithelioma, nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma, Wilms tumor, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, pineoblastoma, pituitary blastoma, ovarian sarcoma, CNS sarcoma and/or thyroid cancer - regardless of their family history. Additional DICER1-related neoplasms may be identified in the future, and they will be added to the protocol as needed\n   * Protocol 02C0052: Fanconi anemia: FA patients have relatively specific birth defects, aplastic anemia, increased chromosome breakage in cells cultured with a DNA crosslinking agent such as mitomycin C (MMC) or diepoxybutane (DEB), pathogenic variant(s) in one of the cloned genes (six genes at this time), or assignment to one of the 7 or more complementation groups. Bone marrow failure is NOT required for the diagnosis, and approximately 25% do not have birth defects. FA has been diagnosed from birth to \\>50 years of age. FA Proven = positive chromosome breakage result, and/or pathogenic variant(s) in a known FANC gene. Patients in whom FA is suspected but whose chromosome breakage test is negative will still be considered if they have sufficient findings that lead the Principal Investigator to think they may be somatic mosaics and warrant further evaluation. Diamond Blackfan anemia: DBA patients have pure red cell aplasia with reticulocytopenia. Approximately 30% have physical abnormalities, often involving malformations of the thumbs. Approximately 90% are diagnosed within the first year of life. A pathogenic variant in a known DBA gene (RPS19 is currently the only known gene) is diagnostic, but lack of a pathogenic variant does not rule out DBA, since the cloned gene is responsible for only approximately 25% of the disease. Since many cases are sporadic or occur in families with silent carriers, patients without a positive family history will be included. Currently DBA is diagnosed by clinical findings after exclusion of known causes of red cell aplasia. Approximately 90% have elevated red cell adenosine deaminase levels, a finding which is supportive, but not diagnostic, of DBA. Dyskeratosis congenita: DC patients develop dyskeratotic nails, lacy hyperpigmentation of the skin and mucous membrane leukoplakia as they age (the diagnostic clinical triad; two of the three are required for a firm diagnosis). Findings in young patients may be very subtle, and diagnoses are usually made in teenagers or young adults. More than 75% are male. DC patients are often diagnosed without hematologic abnormalities by dermatologists; however, some patients present with aplastic anemia prior to the evolution of the syndrome-related physical features. A pathogenic variant in the DKC1 gene is diagnostic, but normal DKC1 does not exclude DC. The diagnosis is often clinical, after exclusion of FA and other IBMFS. Shwachman Diamond Syndrome: SDS patients have neutropenia, malabsorption and failure to thrive due to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The gene has not yet been cloned. Pancreatic insufficiency is documented by direct measurement of pancreatic enzymes, low serum immunoreactive trypsinogen, or elevated fecal fat levels. Neutropenia requires an absolute neutrophil count of \\<1500/mm3 on multiple occasions. Other causes of malabsorption such as cystic fibrosis, Pearson syndrome, and Johansson-Blizzard syndrome must be excluded. Cystic fibrosis will be excluded in patients who have a positive sweat test performed at an approved CF center. Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia: These patients have early onset thrombocytopenia (\\<150,000/mm3), usually within the first year of life, due to absent, diminished, or abnormal bone marrow megakaryocytes, without antiplatelet antibodies. Physical examination is often normal; in particular, there are no abnormalities of the radial rays. Pathogenic variant(s) in the MPL gene are diagnostic, but normal MPL does not exclude this diagnosis. Thrombocytopenia absent radii: TAR patients have absent radii, usually bilateral, with intact thumbs (in contrast with FA and trisomy 18, where thumbs are absent if radii are absent), and thrombocytopenia at birth. Other radial aplasia syndromes such as Holt-Oram syndrome or VATER syndrome must be excluded. Severe Congenital Neutropenia: Patients with SCN have persistent and noncyclic low absolute neutrophil counts, with more than 2 measurements \\<200/mm3, and a history of pyogenic infections during the first year of life, and bone marrow maturation arrest at the promyelocyte/myelocyte stage. They do not have birth defects, and they usually have normal hemoglobin and platelet counts. They are designated Kostmann Syndrome (KS) only if there is a pattern of autosomal recessive inheritance. Pathogenic variant(s) in the neutrophil elastase gene (ELA2) are supportive of the diagnosis of SCN, but do not distinguish SCN patients from those with cyclic neutropenia, which is milder and not preleukemic. Many of the cases of SCN have been shown to be due to dominant pathogenic variant(s)s in ELA2. Pearson Syndrome: Pearson syndrome consists of malabsorption, neutropenia, alone or with anemia and/or thrombocytopenia, and metabolic acidosis. Onset is in infancy or early childhood. The diagnosis is strongly suspected if bone marrow examination reveals vacuoles in myeloid and erythroid progenitors, and ring sideroblasts. Confirmation derives from detection of deletions in mitochondrial DNA, which range from 2 to 8 kb in size, and include the respiratory enzymes. Absence of reports to date of cancer or leukemia in this syndrome may derive from early death due to the metabolic problems. Other bone marrow failure syndromes: There are occasional patients with a pattern of hematologic abnormalities, physical findings, malignancies, or family histories which are not characteristic of the syndromes described above, but which nonetheless suggests that they have a genetic bone marrow failure syndrome. There may be similar cases in the literature, or in the experience of the investigator, which may ultimately lead to assignment of these patients to a known or new syndrome. There are additional bone marrow failure syndromes which are even more rare, such as Revesz, WT, IVIC, radio-ulnar synostosis, ataxia-pancytopenia, etc. Syndromic classification of extremely rare disorders is facilitated if they are collected in one center. Since malignancy is often part of these syndromes, they will be eligible for enrollment in this protocol.\n   * Protocol 02C0211: Known or suspected factor(s) predisposing to melanoma, either genetic or congenital factors (giant congenital nevi, dysplastic nevi, Spitzoid tumors), or unusual demographic features (e.g., very young age of onset, multiple melanomas, previous history of heritable retinoblastoma, Hodgkin's disease, lymphoma, immunodeficiency syndrome, or organ transplant).\n   * Protocol 10CN188: Diagnose with chordoma or related tumor at any age and any primary site.\n   * Protocol 78C0039: Known or suspected factor(s) predisposing to neoplasia, either genetic and/or congenital factors (birth defects, metabolic phenotype, chromosomal anomalies or Mendelian traits associated with tumors), environmental exposure (medications, occupation, radiation, diet, infectious agents, etc.), or unusual demographic features (very young age of onset, multiple tumors, etc.). Personal and family medical history must be verified through questionnaires, interviews, and review of pathology slides and medical records. For familial neoplasms, two or more living affected cases among family members are required. The types of familial tumors that we are currently actively accruing include Familial Cancers: bladder, brain, chordoma, lung, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCC) Familial Benign Neoplasms: meningiomas, neurofibromatosis 2 (bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis) The types of familial tumors under active accrual and study are predominantly investigator- and hypothesis-driven. This approach permits CGB investigators to remain alert to the opportunities afforded by clusters of rare tumors in families and individuals, and to be more responsive to the dynamic research priorities in cancer genetics.\n3. Personal or family history of a genetic variant in a hereditary cancer predisposition being actively investigated in the following CGB study protocols:\n\n   * Protocol 11C0255: A personal history of a germline TP53 mutation; or, - A first or second- degree relative of a TP53 mutation carrier, regardless of mutation status\n   * Protocol 20C0107: Individuals with a germline variant (P/LP or a variant of uncertain significance but predicted bioinformatically to be damaging) in a RASopathy-associated gene are eligible. These include but are not limited to: BRAF, CBL, HRAS, KRAS, LZTR1, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, MAP3K8, MRAS, NRAS, PPP1CB, PTPN11, RAF1, RASA1, RASA2, RIT1, RRAS, SHOC2, SOS1, SPRED1. From herein, we refer to 1) individuals with germline pathogenic variation in a RAS pathway gene AND 2) individuals with a clinical RASopathy diagnosis but in whom a genetic variant has not yet been identified as \"carriers.\" The first member of a family to be identified is termed a \"proband.\"\n   * Protocol 11C0034: An individual with a known or suspected DICER1 disease associated variant.\n   * Protocol 02C0052: An individual with a pathogenic variant(s) in a known FANC gene. Individual with Diamond Blackfan Anemia with a pathogenic variant in a known DBA gene (RPS19). Individuals with Dyskeratosis congenita with a pathogenic variant in the DKC1 gene. Individuals with Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia with pathogenic variants) in the MPL gene. Individuals with Severe Congenital Neutropenia with a pathogenic variant(s) in the neutrophil elastase gene (ELA2).\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA\n\nWhile this protocol is intended to be used by those meeting the inclusion criteria above, there are no explicit exclusion criteria for this study, since the initiative to complete the eligibility screener survey is at the will of the participant or his or her parent/guardian/LAR.",

The study will involve approximately 40 study centers in the United States, Canada, and Europe with expertise in the management of subjects with ACLF.\n\nSubjects with ACLF at a high risk of hospital mortality will be enrolled. The study will consist of a Screening Period during which subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive either standard medical treatment (SMT) + PE-A 5% (treatment group) or SMT only (control group), followed by a Treatment Period, and a Follow-up Period.\n\nThe Treatment Period for subjects in the SMT+ PE-A 5% treatment group will be between 7 and 17 days, depending on ACLF evolution.\n\nThe Treatment Period for subjects in the SMT control group will be a minimum of 7 days for all subjects and up to 17 days depending on the ACLF evolution. Subjects in this group will receive SMT according to the institution's standards.\n\nThe Follow-up Period for subjects in both groups will be 90 days.",
          "detailedDescription": "Approximately 380 subjects with cirrhosis, ACLF, and high risk of hospital mortality (ACLF-1b, ACLF-2, or ACLF-3a) will be included in this study after obtaining written informed consent. In case of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), written informed consent will be obtained from a relative or a legally authorized representative if the subject is considered incompetent to consent.\n\nRandomization of subjects will be stratified by region (European Union \\[EU\\] or North America \\[NA\\]) and the 3 ACLF grades (ACLF-1b, ACLF-2, or ACLF-3a). Within each stratum (ie, each unique combination of region and ACLF grade), subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 2 treatment groups below:\n\n* SMT+PE-A 5% (treatment group)\n* SMT (control group)\n\nSMT + PE-A 5% Treatment Group:\n\nPE-A 5% will be performed using 5% albumin (Albutein® 5%) as the main replacement fluid administered intravenously. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) will be given after each PE-A 5% session to prevent coagulopathy.\n\nThe exact number of sessions will be determined by the pattern of response (achieving complete response or no improvement/deterioration of ACLF) to PE-A 5% therapy. IVIGs will be administered to prevent the development of hypogammaglobulinemia and infection.\n\nSMT Control Group:\n\nThe Treatment Period will be 7 days for all subjects and will be prolonged depending on subject's ACLF evolution to up to 17 days.\n\nSubjects in both the SMT+ PE-A 5% treatment group and the SMT control group will be followed for 90 days after randomization. During the entire study, the safety of both groups will be monitored by a Data Safety Monitoring Board."

This study will not only strictly follow the latest domestic expert consensus and standards, but also aims to address current pain points in manual interpretation. It seeks to provide technical support for standardizing, objectifying, and streamlining CLDN18.2 testing, thereby advancing the application of precision medicine in the diagnosis and treatment of digestive system diseases. The project has clear clinical necessity and broad application prospects."

          "detailedDescription": "The clinical spectrum of Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC) is wide and characterized by the association of permanent and paroxysmal (palsy, dystonia, ocular, epileptic, dysautonomic events) neurological events, with onset in childhood. Most of AHC patients carry mutations in the ATP1A3 gene. This gene encodes the Na+/K+ ATPase witch is a transmembrane ion pump generating chemical and electrical gradient of sodium and potassium across the plasma membrane. Those paroxystic events in AHC patients with mutations in the ATP1A3 gene could be associated with a glucidic/energetic metabolism or intracerebral excitability disorder.\n\nTriheptanoin is a triglyceride, whose derivatives pass the blood - brain barrier and enhance the Krebs cycle functions. Triheptanoin could therefore allow energy supply to the brain, which is essential for the functioning of the Na+/ K+ ATPase that consumes a significant amount of energy in the brain.\n\nThe investigators goal is to do a pilot study to test the effectiveness on paroxystic manifestations and the safety of triheptanoin in a small group of patients with Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood secondary to ATP1A3 mutations."

Chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil, mitomycin, and irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. PIPAC is a minimally invasive procedure that involves the administration of intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The study device consists of a nebulizer (a device that turns liquids into a fine mist), which is connected to a high-pressure injector, and inserted into the abdomen (part of the body that contains the digestive organs) during a laparoscopic procedure (a surgery using small incisions to introduce air and to insert a camera and other instruments in the abdominal cavity for diagnosis and/or to perform routine surgical procedures). Pressurization of the liquid chemotherapy through the study device results in aerosolization (a fine mist or spray) of the chemotherapy intra-abdominally (into the abdomen). Giving chemotherapy through PIPAC may reduce the amount of chemotherapy needed to achieve acceptable drug concentration, and therefore potentially reduces side effects and toxicities.",

To evaluate the safety of pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) in 3 groups of patients: peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) due to primary ovarian, uterine, or gastric carcinoma (Arm 1); PC due to primary colorectal or appendiceal carcinoma (Arm 2).\n\nII. To evaluate safety of PIPAC and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PIPAC with MMC in patients with PC due to colorectal or appendiceal carcinoma (Arm 3).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Ability to proceed to cytoreduction with/without hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) (Arm 3 patients).\n\nII. Efficacy will be assessed by:\n\nIa. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), if available, version 1.1 via computed tomography (CT) scan at baseline (week 10, and 6 weeks after completing treatment; and at 18 weeks).\n\nIb. Peritoneal regression grading score (PRGS) via biopsy at each cycle (both pre-PIPAC and post-PIPAC peritoneal samples will be obtained).\n\nIc. Peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) at the time of laparoscopy. II. Post-operative surgical complications by Claven-Dindo classification evaluated at 4, 10, and 16 weeks (4 weeks after each PIPAC).\n\nIII. Progression-free survival. IV. PIPAC technical failure rate.

Patient-reported health state/quality of life and symptoms before treatment and at 6, 12, and 18 weeks as measured by the European Quality of Life Five Dimension Five Level Scale Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI).\n\nVI. Functional status, as measured by the number of daily steps before and after treatments (Vivofit 4 wristband pedometer - Garmin Company).\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Correlative/translational studies to characterize the tumor microenvironment, subclonal evolution, genomics, and pharmacokinetics of peritoneal tumors.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients with ovarian, uterine, or gastric cancer, undergo PIPAC with doxorubicin intraperitoneally (IP), followed by cisplatin IP. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients with colorectal or appendiceal cancer undergo PIPAC with oxaliplatin IP. For cycles 2 and 3, patients receive leucovorin intravenously (IV) over 10 minutes and fluorouracil IV over 15 minutes 1-24 hours before undergoing PIPAC. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM III: Patients with colorectal or appendiceal cancer who have undergo at least 4 months (or 8 cycles) of first-line standard of care chemotherapy but have not progressed on second line chemotherapy undergo PIPAC with mitomycin IP. Patients also receive standard of care irinotecan IV over 90 on day 1, leucovorin IV over 30 minutes on day 1, and fluorouracil IV on days 1-2 during weeks 2, 4, 8, 10, 14 and 16. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 3 years."

          "briefSummary": "This cohort study aims to assess the comparative effectiveness of tirzepatide versus semaglutide with respect to cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.",
          "detailedDescription": "Both semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), and tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1RA, are currently approved treatments to control blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and to lower weight in patients with obesity, with or without T2D. Obesity is a leading risk factor for the onset and the progression of heart failure (HF), especially HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Due to their potent weight-lowering action, semaglutide and tirzepatide have been recently evaluated in placebo-controlled trials conducted among persons with obesity and HFpEF, with or without T2D. These trials showed that semaglutide and tirzepatide reduced HF symptoms and HF events, compared to placebo.\n\nIn this new user, active comparator cohort study, the investigators will identify commercially insured adults (aged \\> 18 years) with T2D and HFpEF who initiated treatment with tirzepatide or semaglutide between June 1, 2022, and December 31, 2024. The investigators will retrieve information for each study participants using deidentified, longitudinal insurance claims data, including demographic characteristics, health plan enrollment status, inpatient and outpatient diagnoses, procedures, health care visits, hospitalizations, and pharmacy dispensing records.\n\nCohort entry is the day of initiation of tirzepatide or semaglutide. The follow-up starts on the day after cohort entry and continue until the occurrence of an outcome, discontinuation, switching, death, end of continuous health plan enrollment or end of the study period. Our primary outcome is a composite of hospitalization for HF or all-cause mortality.\n\nThe investigators will use propensity score adjustment to mitigate the risk of confounding. The investigators will calculate the number of events, incidence rates, and rate differences per 1000 person-years. Cox proportional hazard models will be used to estimate hazard ratios with their 95% confidence intervals."

          "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. Surgery to remove the tumors is the standard treatment for people diagnosed with early stages of NSCLC. Despite complete removal of these tumors, many recur (happen again). An FDA-approved drug combination to treat early-stage NSCLC prior to the surgery is durvalumab plus standard chemotherapy. The FDA approved infusion drug azacytidine \\[AZA\\] is used to treat several diseases because it can rapidly kill dividing cells (including cancer cells) but it is not approved for NSCLC. An inhaled (aerosolized) form of AZA is also not approved for NSCLC. However, researchers want to know if an inhaled version of AZA can help improve treatment of people with NSCLC because inhaled AZA goes directly into the lungs with limited absorption into the bloodstream.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo find the safest and most effective dose of inhaled AZA in participants with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that can still be removed by surgery.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults aged 18 and older with operable early-stage NSCLC. Participants will be required to also enroll in NIH protocol 06C0014 which allows for pre- and post-treatment biopsies and bloodwork to be obtained for additional research studies.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They will have a physical exam with blood tests. Their medical records will be reviewed. They will have imaging scans and tests of their heart and lung functions. Participants will be required to have a tissue sample (biopsy) taken of their tumor prior to receiving study drug and again during surgery after Cycle 3; airway tissue biopsies and collection of collect bronchial (lung) fluid may also be done.\n\nParticipants will receive the study treatment for 3 cycles. Each cycle is 21 days. They will need to come to the NIH Clinical Center (CC) on days 1-4 of Cycles 1-3.\n\nAZA will be given as a drug mist that can be inhaled (like the type of mist in an asthma inhaler) using a nebulizer at the NIH Clinical Center (CC) for 3 days in a row (consecutive days) during the first week of each cycle. The participant will inhale the AZA drug mist for 20 to 30 minutes each time. Participants will also receive durvalumab and a specific 2-drug assigned chemotherapy by intravenous (IV) infusion on day 4 of each cycle.\n\nParticipants will have a follow-up visit 2 weeks after their last dose of study drugs. Then they will have planned surgery to remove the tumors.\n\nParticipants will have additional follow-up visits at the NIH CC about 1 and 3 months after the surgery, and then for every 3 months for up to 3 years.\n\n...",
          "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and accounted for nearly 160,000 deaths in 2023 in the US.\n* Paradigm shifting results of immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy in locally advanced, inoperable, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have prompted clinical evaluation of these agents administered in the perioperative setting for patients with earlystage, operable disease.\n* Pathologic complete responses (pCR) are observed in approximately 10% of early-stage NSCLC following CPI monotherapy and between 20-30% following platinum based chemotherapy and CPI treatment; as such most NSCLC are intrinsically resistant to immune checkpoint blockade.\n* Many of the pathways that drive pulmonary carcinogenesis and render NSCLC resistant to immunotherapy are mediated by potentially reversible epigenetic mechanisms of which DNA methylation appears to be predominant.\n* DNA demethylating agents such as azacytidine and decitabine can directly enhance the immunogenicity of lung cancer cells and ameliorate immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment (TME).\n* Poor bioavailability, as well as pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic limitations and systemic toxicities prevent optimal dosing of DNA demethylating agents for the treatment of solid tumors.\n* One potential strategy to enhance the delivery of DNA demethylating agents to early-stage NSCLC while minimizing systemic toxicities is to administer these drugs by inhalation techniques.\n* Preclinical studies have demonstrated that aerosolized AZA mediates epigenetic activation of tumor suppressor gene expression in orthotopic human NSCLC, and significantly prolongs the survival of mice bearing these xenografts without systemic toxicities.\n* Conceivably, by simultaneously targeting lung cancer cells and their immunosuppressive TME, inhaled AZA may enhance the efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy for early-stage NSCLC.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Phase I:\n\n  --To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of neoadjuvant aerosolized AZA in participants with operable early-stage NSCLC treated with standard of care (SOC) platinum-based chemotherapy and Durvalumab.\n* Phase II:\n\n  * To determine the frequency of pathologic complete responses (pCR) in participants receiving aerosolized AZA, durvalumab, and SOC platinum-based chemotherapy as induction therapy for early-stage NSCLC.\n\nEligibility Criteria:\n\n* Stage IB-IIIA NSCLC irrespective of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression status.\n* Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.\n* No prior therapy for NSCLC.\n* Disease that can be safely accessed via bronchoscopic, thoracoscopic, or percutaneous biopsy, and participant willingness to undergo tumor biopsy before treatment (all participants) and bronchoscopic evaluation for PK analysis during treatment (Phase I only).\n* Willing to undergo tumor resection per standard of care (SOC) guidelines following induction therapy.\n* Age \\>=18 years.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of \\<=1.\n* Adequate organ and marrow function.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Eligible participants will receive aerosolized AZA via AeroEclipse(R) II Breath Actuated nebulizer on three consecutive days (i.e., days 1, 2, 3) of a 21-day cycle for 3 cycles. Platinumdoublet chemotherapy using SOC guidelines and durvalumab will be administered on day 4 of each cycle.\n* Anatomic resection \\[lobectomy/segmentectomy/pneumonectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection (MLND)\\] will be performed within 3 weeks following completion of neoadjuvant therapy regimen.\n* The dose of AZA will be escalated using a 3+3 design with no intra-patient dose escalation (45 - 75 mg/m\\^2/inhalation) to maximize intra-tumoral DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 depletion while avoiding dose-limiting pulmonary or systemic toxicities attributable to this agent during the three cycles of therapy.\n* Once the RP2D of aerosolized AZA has been defined either by toxicity or feasibility, that cohort will be expanded to a total of 17 participants to determine pathologic complete response rates at the RP2D using a Simon optimal design for phase II trials.\n* If 4 or more of 17 participants treated at the RP2D experience pCR, an additional 20 evaluable participants will be accrued (2nd stage).\n* Pharmacokinetic (PK) / pharmacodynamic (PD) effects as well as DNMT, CTA, and immune-related gene expression levels in tumor tissues may be evaluated.\n* Additional studies will be performed to examine if the treatment regimen alters DNA methylation and cytokine levels and modulates the phenotypes of immune cells in pulmonary lavage fluids.\n* Up to 52 participants may receive study intervention on this protocol."

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to identify genes that convey susceptibility to congenital diaphragmatic hernia in humans. The identification of such genes, and examination of their structure and function, will enable a delineation of molecular pathogenesis and, ultimately, prevention or treatment of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. There are many different possible modes of inheritance for congenital anomalies, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and multifactorial. Multi-factorial inheritance is responsible for many common medical disorders, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, diabetes and cancer. This type of inheritance pattern appears to involve environmental factors as well as a combination of genetic variations that together can predispose to or produce congenital anomalies, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia.\n\nOur study is designed to establish a small, well-defined genetic resource consisting of 1) Nuclear families suitable for linkage analysis by parametric,non-parametric (e.g. sib pairs, TDT) and association techniques, 2) Individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia who can be directly screened for allelic variation in candidate genes, and 3) Individuals who can serve as controls (are unaffected by congenital diaphragmatic hernia). Neonates and their families will be collected from homogenous and heterogeneous populations. By characterizing diverse populations, it should be possible to increase the likelihood of demonstration of genetic variation in selected candidate genes that can then be used in association and linkage studies in individual subjects with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.",
          "detailedDescription": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a birth defect that occurs when the diaphragm (thin sheet of muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest) does not form properly. When an opening is present in the diaphragm, organs that are normally in the abdomen can be pushed (herniated) through the opening and be present in the chest. Currently little is known about why this birth defect occurs.\n\nThrough this study \"\"Molecular Genetic Analysis of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia\" the investigators hope to learn more about whether certain genes contribute to CDH. Genes are the instructions or blueprints for our bodies. They tell our bodies how to grow and develop. Sometimes when a mistake occurs in one or more of our genes our body does not develop properly and this can lead to a CDH. The investigators hope that the information gained through studying the genes of children with CDH and their parents, will lead to significant advances in the diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and treatment of this disease."

          "briefSummary": "In 2020, a cervical screening center was established in Zaporizhzhia (Ukraine), initiating a pilot project to evaluate the prevalence of HPV among women in Eastern Ukraine. The findings were intended to lay the groundwork for the Ukrainian Ministry of Health in establishing a structured national screening program. However, all efforts were halted due to the nearby armed conflict, situated just 40 kilometers from the border.\n\nThe World Health Organization's goal to eliminate cervical cancer globally has a gap when it comes to managing cancer control during crises like armed conflicts. We propose a demonstration project to assess whether a simpler, yet modern, cervical cancer control strategy (based on using self-sampling for HPV detection) could also be effective for cervical cancer screening in Zaporizhzhia.\n\nWomen aged 30-60 years who have not had a recent negative HPV test will be invited to participate. Participants receive a self-sampling kit from their primary care provider and can return the sample free of charge to the clinic or community volunteers. All samples are analyzed in accredited laboratories in Zaporizhzhia.\n\nHPV-positive women will receive follow-up care according to national guidelines, including referral to gynecologists for additional tests and treatment if needed. HPV-negative women will be reassured and advised on future screening intervals.\n\nThe study also evaluates how well the screening program can be implemented during conflict conditions. This includes measuring women's acceptance of self-sampling, the willingness of providers to adopt the procedures, and whether the screening process is feasible, practical, and sustainable. Additional process evaluation will explore how the program adapts to challenges such as migration, disrupted health services, and safety concerns.\n\nThis project is conducted through collaboration between Zaporizhzhia State Medical and Pharmaceutical University, the Charitable Foundation \"World Against Cancer,\" and Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, which provides quality assurance support for laboratory procedures. The goal is to establish a safe, effective, and sustainable cervical cancer screening model that can be used in conflict-affected regions and similar settings.",
          "detailedDescription": "Cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide and is almost always caused by persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). Organized screening programs using HPV testing have been shown to reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality. However, in settings affected by armed conflict, access to preventive services is disrupted, and clinic-based screening becomes difficult to maintain.\n\nIn 2020, a cervical screening center was established in the Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine, close to the conflict zone. A pilot HPV-based screening initiative was launched to estimate HPV prevalence and support the development of an organized national screening program. This effort was interrupted by the escalation of the war, which led to disruption of services, population displacement, and increased barriers to preventive care.\n\nThis study aims to revive and expand these efforts by implementing an HPV-based cervical cancer screening program using self-sampling in Zaporizhzhia. The project leverages the long-standing experience from Sweden in organized screening, HPV laboratory quality assurance, and self-sampling implementation, while adapting the model to conflict-affected conditions in Ukraine.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe main objectives are to:\n\n* Improve access to cervical cancer screening for women in Zaporizhzhia by offering HPV testing on self-collected samples.\n* Ensure accurate and reliable HPV testing through participation in external proficiency schemes and the use of accredited laboratories.\n* Provide timely and guideline-based follow-up for women who test positive for high-risk HPV.\n* Evaluate key implementation outcomes (e.g., acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility).\n* Conduct a process evaluation to understand how the intervention is adapted and sustained in the context of ongoing conflict.\n\nStudy Design and Intervention\n\nWomen aged 30-60 years living in Zaporizhzhia who have not had a documented negative HPV test in the past three years will be eligible. No exclusions are made based on socioeconomic status or ethnicity. Women with prior hysterectomy or inability to provide informed consent will be excluded.\n\nThe intervention comprises several coordinated components:\n\n1. Quality assurance of HPV testing:\n\n   Two PCR laboratories in Zaporizhzhia participate in annual external proficiency testing coordinated by the International HPV Reference Center. One laboratory serves as the primary testing site and a second as a contingency laboratory. Only assays that achieve proficiency for high-risk HPV detection will be used.\n2. Centralized database:\n\n   A secure electronic platform (selfsamplingukraine.ua) is developed to collect/register: patient registration, risk classification, kit distribution, patient feedback and HPV test results. The database functions both as a clinical registry and as the primary data source for monitoring, evaluation, and implementation outcomes.\n3. Protocols and training:\n\n   Standard operating procedures define eligibility criteria, self-sampling instructions, sample handling, HPV testing, result reporting, and follow-up pathways. Healthcare providers receive structured training on these procedures, including how to counsel women, interpret HPV results, and arrange follow-up.\n4. Self-sampling and HPV testing:\n\n   Primary care physicians and collaborating partners (NGOs) distribute self-sampling kits with written instructions. Women can return the samples directly to clinics, or via volunteers from the Charitable Foundation \"World Against Cancer.\" Collected samples are tested for high-risk HPV types in the accredited laboratories. Regular internal and external quality controls are performed.\n5. Result reporting and follow-up:\n\n   HPV test results are uploaded to the secure platform and made available to the woman's primary care physician, who then informs the participant and organises follow-up. Women with HPV 16/18 are prioritised for expedited gynaecological assessment (colposcopy) within two months. Women with other high-risk HPV types are managed according to national or project-specific guidelines (e.g., repeat testing at 12 months or referral for colposcopy). HPV-negative women are reassured and advised on routine screening intervals.\n6. Implementation and Process Evaluation\n\nAn embedded implementation research and process evaluation component will assess how the intervention functions in a conflict-affected setting. Data sources include: a) Routine registry data participation, kit return rates, HPV positivity, and follow-up completion; b) Structured surveys of participants to measure acceptability, perceived barriers and facilitators, and satisfaction with self-sampling and follow-up; c) Surveys and semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers and key stakeholders to assess adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, workload, and perceived sustainability; d) review of project documents, meeting minutes, and timelines to document adaptations over time.\n\nQuantitative analyses will use descriptive statistics for participation and HPV outcomes and, where relevant, comparative analyses to explore factors associated with screening uptake and follow-up completion. Qualitative data will be analysed thematically to identify key themes regarding acceptability, feasibility, and contextual influences.\n\nTarget Population and Expected Impact\n\nThe anticipated sample size is approximately 1,000 women, corresponding to the estimated number of eligible women reachable within the current healthcare system in Zaporizhzhia. All eligible women who consent will be included.\n\nThe target population is women aged 30-60 years living in Zaporizhzhia, a region affected by war and health system disruption. The intervention is expected to:\n\n* Increase access to screening by offering a convenient self-sampling option.\n* Enable earlier detection of high-risk HPV infections and precancerous lesions.\n* Reduce the burden of advanced cervical cancer and the associated physical, emotional, and economic consequences.\n* Provide an evidence-based, scalable model for cervical cancer screening in conflict and other resource-constrained settings.\n\nThe study also aims to reduce inequalities in access to preventive services by prioritising outreach and free participation for women who might otherwise be missed by traditional clinic-based screening.\n\nEthical Approval\n\nEthical approval has been granted by the Ethics Committee of the Educational and Scientific Medical Center \"University Clinic,\" Zaporizhzhia State Medical and Pharmaceutical University (Protocol No. 9, 24 September 2024, with earlier approvals). Karolinska Institutet has received approval from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (2024-06579-01) to conduct quality assurance activities related to the project."

          "briefSummary": "Vitamin D is important for bone health and recent research has emphasized the importance of adequate vitamin D levels for bone healing, wound healing, and possibly preventing infections post-operatively. This study will assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on patient outcomes following ankle arthrodesis or first metatarsophalangeal joint arthrodesis.",
          "detailedDescription": "The current status of knowledge includes preliminary research correlating hypovitaminosis, or low vitamin D status, to worse outcomes. In orthopaedic patients, vitamin D deficiency is prevalent among those scheduled to undergo surgery.\n\nVitamin D is important for calcium homeostasis and bone health, as well as for activation and differentiation of macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes. A recent retrospective review of outcomes in revision total joint arthroplasty patients showed that patients with low vitamin D had higher rates of postoperative complications and periprosthetic infections. Additionally, another retrospective study correlated low vitamin D levels with lower patient reported outcomes (PROs) after total hip arthroplasty. Current retrospective studies suggest that having low vitamin D levels may lead to impaired fracture healing, increased wound complication rates, and a higher risk of infections.\n\nGiven this background information, this study will investigate a series of patients undergoing ankle arthrodesis and first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP) arthrodesis. Our study will serve to enhance the current knowledge as a level 1 randomized control study on the effect of Vitamin D supplementation on the complication rate following these two arthrodesis procedures. Our endpoints for complications will be defined as infection, wound healing complications, need for readmission, need for re-operation and nonunion as evidenced clinically and radiographically."

The purpose of this study is to find out whether a medicine called BI 764198 helps people with FSGS.\n\nParticipants are put into 2 groups randomly, which means by chance. Every participant has an equal chance of being in each group. One group takes BI 764198 tablets, and the other group takes placebo tablets. Placebo tablets look like BI 764198 tablets but do not contain any medicine.\n\nParticipants take a tablet once a day for up to 2 years. All participants also continue their standard medication for FSGS.\n\nParticipants are in the study for up to 2 years. During this time, they visit the study site about every 3 months. Participants regularly collect urine samples. This is done to check their kidneys. The results are compared between the two groups to see whether the treatment works. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects."

The objective is to explore whether non-invasive neuromodulation for sleep is non-inferior to invasive neuromodulation. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either SGB or taVNS treatment. Sleep quality will be assessed using an actigraphy device and sleep scales within four days post-surgery, and the incidence of sleep disturbances will be followed up within 30 days post-surgery."

          "briefSummary": "Opportunistic infections are caused by bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi or viruses that do not normally cause infections in people with healthy immune systems. Some of these infections can cause public health concerns, especially in areas with limited access to treatment. People who acquire opportunistic infections usually have diseases that affect their immune systems, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or do not have enough white blood cells to fight the infection. However, some people acquire opportunistic infections even though they have normal amounts of white blood cells and are free from known diseases that harm their immune systems. This study will investigate some of the reasons that otherwise healthy people get opportunistic infections to learn more about why some people are more likely to have them.\n\nThis study will include up to 210 HIV-negative males and females older than 18 years of age who have opportunistic infections. The patients will be drawn from multiple sites in Thailand and Taiwan including Khon Kaen University Hospital, Siriraj Hospital, Ramathibodi Hospital, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Cheng-Kung University Hospital\n\nPatients will undergo an initial evaluation that will include a physical examination, medical history, and blood and urine testing. Additional tests will be conducted if the researchers consider that the tests are medically necessary to treat the opportunistic infection; the results of the tests will be reviewed and saved for study purposes. Depending on the severity of the infection, the initial evaluation may take more than 1 day to complete.\n\nAfter the evaluation, patients will be given standard and appropriate medicines to treat the infections.\n\nPatients will return for follow-up visits to allow researchers to monitor their condition and to assess how well the patient is responding to the treatment. Patients will be evaluated by the study researchers at least once a year for 2 years following the initial treatment.\n\n...",
          "detailedDescription": "The acquisition of opportunistic infections has been causally linked to innate and acquired immunodeficiencies. We have recently identified a population of Asian women with autoantibodies to interferon gamma (IFN?), all of whom were diagnosed by virtue of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. Similar patient populations have been reported from Thailand, and we have found similar autoantibodies in anonymous serum samples from there. In addition, many of the Thai patients who have disseminated or lymphatic nontuberculous infections have had other opportunistic infections (OI), such as salmonella, penicilliosis, and histoplasmosis. However, they have normal lymphocyte counts and are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative. Therefore, the identification of autoantibodies to a critical cytokine, the occurrence of opportunistic infections, and the lack of other common explanations suggests that this is an important population to study. We propose to enroll patients in a natural history study of non-HIV opportunistic infections to explore the presence of autoantibodies to cytokines, and to examine potential immunogenetic factors influencing the development of this disease. Plasma, cells, and DNA samples will be obtained and stored for use in this study. This study will accrue up to 265 patients over 5 years as per the protocol with follow up for 15 years on each patient, sample size justification and the groups described in the protocol."

They will also be asked not to download or use any new HT mobile apps during the study period. In HK, all citizens have unlimited access to GOPCs and emergency departments for health problems.

ABPM or HBPM are preferred to office BP due to their superior reproducibility and predictivity to cardiovascular outcomes. Furthermore, office BP misclassifies 30-40% of patients as having suboptimal BP control due to white-coat effect. From our pilot study, some patients with optimal BP are reluctant to undergo ABPM before recruitment into the RCT, and HBPM is more acceptable to these patients and is therefore included. According to local and international guidelines, optimal out-of-office daytime BP should be \\&lt;135/85 mmHg for patients without comorbidities and \\&lt;130/85 mmHg for patients with comorbidities that increase cardiovascular risk (i.e. stroke, ischaemic heart diseases, heart failure, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic kidney diseases) respectively;\n* (iv) can read basic Chinese (language used in the HealthCap);\n* (v) have used any mobile app (not HT-related) in the previous 1 year; and\n* (vii) aged between 18-80.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* (i) cannot provide informed consent;\n* (ii) unwillingness to conduct HBPM or repeated ABPM;\n* (iii) relative contraindications to ABPM (i.e., diagnosed atrial fibrillation, nighttime workers, occupational drivers, or patients with bleeding tendencies);\n* (iv) have severe mental illnesses that impair their ability to use HealthCap, including those diagnosed with schizophrenia, dementia, or as being actively suicidal;\n* (v) a diagnosis of other acute or chronic diseases that need regular physical assessments and/or medication changes (e.g., suboptimally controlled DM \\[e.g., glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c)≥7%\\], depression requiring medications, active cancer); and (vi) predicted lifespan of \\&lt;1 year.",

          "briefSummary": "This randomized phase II trial studies how well oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (MV-NIS) compared to investigator's choice chemotherapy works in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian, or peritoneal cancer. Measles virus, which has been changed in a certain way, may be able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells.",
          "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Compare clinical efficacy of Arm A (MV-NIS therapy) and Arm B (standard cytotoxic chemotherapy), as measured by overall survival (OS).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Compare progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival at 12 months (OS12), progression-free survival at six months (PFS6), and objective response rate (ORR) between MV-NIS therapy and standard chemotherapy.\n\nII. Assess safety and tolerability of MV-NIS, and compare with standard chemotherapy.\n\nIII. Compare quality of life as assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian (FACT-O) between MV-NIS and standard chemotherapy.\n\nTRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Assess the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination and biodistribution of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with MV-NIS using single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging within the MV-NIS treatment arm.\n\nII. Assess viremia, viral replication, and viral shedding/persistence following intraperitoneal administration within the NV-NIS treatment arm.\n\nIII. Measure humoral and cellular immune responses to MV-NIS within the NV-NIS treatment arm.\n\nIV. Measure changes in anti-ovarian cancer (OC) immune responses in both treatment arms.\n\nV. Perform transcriptomic analysis on tumor biopsy specimens to determine a gene expression profile predictive of therapeutic response to MV-NIS.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM A: Patients receive oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter intraperitoneally (IP) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM B: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1, or gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, or topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, or paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients may also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, topotecan hydrochloride, or paclitaxel. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for 5 years."

HOPE-Genomics is a web-based education tool that teaches cancer/leukemia patients, and patients who may be at high-risk for developing cancer, about genomic testing and provide patients with information about their own genomic test results. The HOPE-Genomics tool may improve patient's genomic knowledge and quality of patient-centered care. In addition, it may also improve education and care quality for future patients.",

Test the efficacy of the HOPE-Genomics intervention in improving patient receipt of guideline-concordant care.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.\n\nARM I (USUAL CARE): Patients receive education pamphlet about whole-genome sequencing (WES) and have their genomics test results returned by their clinician in a typical manner.\n\nARM II (RETURN OF RESULTS ONLY): Patients receive their genomics test results both from their clinician and from the HOPE-Genomics tool. Patients then view HOPE-Genomics tool over 15-20 minutes after their results are available.\n\nARM III (RETURN OF RESULTS PLUS PRE-TEST EDUCATION): Patients view HOPE-Genomics tool (containing educational content) over 15-20 minutes before their sequencing results are available. Patients also receive their genomics test results both from their clinician and from the HOPE-Genomics tool.\n\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 3 and 9 months after receiving genomic test results."

The overall FACToR score is computed by summing all items after reverse scoring the positivity subscale, resulting in a total range of 0 to 48. Higher total scores indicate greater psychosocial impact, which is considered a worse outcome. The PAGIS Certainty Subscale consists of 6 items scored on a 1-6 scale, with a total range of 6-36.

The overall FACToR score is computed by summing all items after reverse scoring the positivity subscale, resulting in a total range of 0 to 48. Higher total scores indicate greater psychosocial impact, which is considered a worse outcome. The PAGIS Certainty Subscale consists of 6 items scored on a 1-6 scale, with a total range of 6-36. Higher scores reflect greater certainty and better psychological adaptation to genetic information, which is considered a positive outcome.",

          "detailedDescription": "This randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to compare postoperative pain levels following single-visit root canal treatment in patients receiving two different analgesic regimens: ibuprofen alone or a combination of ibuprofen and alprazolam.\n\nEligible patients will be screened through detailed medical and dental histories, clinical examinations, and necessary diagnostic tests, including periapical radiographs. Participants meeting the inclusion criteria will be divided into two equal groups using a scientific random number table to ensure unbiased allocation. Matching will be performed based on relevant variables such as age, gender, and tooth location to minimize confounding factors.\n\nRoot canal therapy will be carried out in a single visit under local anesthesia (Septodent, Lignospan Special; 2% lignocaine hydrochloride with 1:80,000 adrenaline) and rubber dam isolation. The working length will be determined 1 mm short of the radiographic apex using an apex locator (DENTSPLY Maillefer, Denta Port ZX) and verified radiographically.\n\nCanal instrumentation will be performed with ProTaper Universal hand files (DENTSPLY Sirona) under copious irrigation with 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution (Henry Schein). Instrumentation will proceed up to F2 ProTaper size. Canal patency will be maintained using a #10 K-file (DENTSPLY Maillefer) between each instrument change. A final rinse with 17% EDTA (ERKAMED Endo-Prep Gel) will be used to remove the smear layer.\n\nAfter chemo-mechanical preparation, canals will be dried with sterile paper points (Sure-Endo). Obturation will be performed using the single-cone technique with F2 gutta-percha points (Bio GP Points, Sure-Endo) and endodontic sealer (President Dental Germany, Endoplus). The master cone position will be confirmed radiographically. Sealer placement will be accomplished with a lentulospiral (DENTSPLY Sirona) in a slow-speed handpiece. All clinical procedures will be completed by a single operator in one visit. After obturation, the access cavity will be sealed with a 4 mm thickness of temporary filling material (DETAX, Fermin). Patients will be recalled after one week for permanent restoration.\n\nBlinding\n\nTo minimize bias, blinding will be implemented at multiple levels:\n\n* Patient Blinding: Patients will be unaware of the specific drug comparison and will be informed only that the study evaluates postoperative pain following root canal therapy.\n* Operator Blinding: A single operator will perform all treatments but will not participate in postoperative pain assessment.\n* Outcome Assessor Blinding: The evaluator responsible for collecting pain scores and performing statistical analysis will be blinded to group assignments.\n\nIntervention Groups\n\nFollowing completion of obturation and placement of the temporary restoration, patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:\n\n* Group 1: Ibuprofen 400 mg (Abbott Brufen)\n* Group 2: Ibuprofen 400 mg (Abbott Brufen) + Alprazolam 0.5 mg (Hilton Pharma Alp)\n\nPain Assessment\n\nParticipants will be provided with a pain diary containing a 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). They will record their pain intensity at 6, 12, and 24 hours after treatment. Pain diaries will be collected during the one-week follow-up visit. Data will be used to compare mean VAS scores between groups to evaluate the efficacy of the two analgesic regimens."

It will also learn about the safety of Gen-1124. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n\\- How does Gen-1124 interact with a human body?\n\nResearchers will look at how Gen-1124 interacts with the body and what side effects it may cause.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Take Gen-1124 for a single dose\n* Remain in clinic for 2 days for checkups and tests\n* Recieve a phone call for a checkup 3 and 7 days after the single dose",
          "detailedDescription": "Approximately 6 healthy male subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be dosed.\n\nThere will be one single dose group of subjects dosed under fed (standardized meal) conditions.\n\nScreening will be initiated up to 28 days before dosing. A follow-up visit will be completed approximately 7 days after dosing. Thus, total duration of subject participation in the study, excluding the Screening visit, will be approximately 8 days.\n\nThe incidence of adverse events from the time of informed consent through the final follow-up visit (end of study). This will be based on the results of:\n\n* Physical exams,\n* Electrocardiography (ECG) results,\n* Clinical laboratory results,\n* Vital signs,\n* Concomitant medications. Plasma levels of GEn-1124 and potential metabolites will be estimated using non-compartmental methods."

          "briefSummary": "The prevalence of overweight and obesity in youth with serious emotional disturbance (SED) exceeds the epidemic levels of overweight and obesity for children in the general population. Associated cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors such as glucose intolerance, hypertension and lipid abnormalities frequently already exist in obese children. Thus, focusing on overweight/obesity in youth with SED is critical to prevent their premature CVD. In 2015 the American Heart Association called attention to mental illnesses in youth as important risk conditions for early CVD and declared the need for transformational change in screening and management of overweight and obesity. Despite this, studies of healthy weight interventions in youth with SED are noticeably absent, and interventions will likely need to be tailored for this population who frequently have impulsivity, oppositional behavior and/or mood symptoms. In the general population, successful interventions targeting youth obesity often include active parental participation. Community mental health programs serving youth typically engage parents as part of routine treatment and therefore provide an unappreciated but potentially important opportunity to address overweight and obesity. The objective of this study is to design and rigorously test an innovative, scalable healthy weight intervention in youth with SED that incorporates parental engagement and provider support. The CHAMPION Trial is a two-arm trial partnering with community mental health organizations in Maryland. We will perform population-based screening to identify youth with overweight and obesity, and recruit and enroll 120 ages 8-18 years with SED with a BMI at or above the 85th%tile. The study will stratify by sex and site and randomly assign participants to receive a) usual care plus educational materials on healthy weight, or b) the 12-month CHAMPION intervention with a health coach who provides healthy lifestyle counseling and support for weight management, a healthy diet and increased physical activity incorporating techniques to engage both the youth and parents. The intervention's first 6 months will include frequent contacts, followed by a 6-month maintenance phase. The primary outcome will be decreased BMI z-score compared to control at 12 months; secondary outcomes include waist circumference, blood pressure, glucose, lipid levels, quality of life, and psychiatric symptoms at 6 and 12 mo. Antecedents of CVD begin early in youth, and those with SED are at particularly high risk. Breaking this cascade of risk factors leading to premature CVD will require capitalizing on the window of opportunity to intervene on overweight and obesity in youth with SED. The CHAMPION Trial will test an innovative, yet practical approach that could be readily incorporated into overall care of youth with SED."

          "briefSummary": "Thoracotomy causes severe postoperative pain that may impair respiratory function and increase complications. This study compares the postoperative analgesic effectiveness of the serratus posterior superior intercostal plane (SPSIP) block and the paravertebral block in patients undergoing thoracotomy. The aim is to determine whether the newly described serratus posterior superior intercostal plane block can serve as a safe and effective alternative to established techniques.",
          "detailedDescription": "Thoracotomy often causes strong postoperative pain because the ribs, muscles, nerves, and pleura are affected during surgery. This pain can make it difficult for patients to breathe well and may increase the chance of lung problems. Paravertebral block is a well-known method for reducing pain after thoracic surgery, but it can sometimes lead to side effects such as low blood pressure or complications related to deeper needle placement.\n\nThe serratus posterior superior intercostal plane block is a newer ultrasound-guided technique. In this method, local anesthetic is injected between the serratus posterior superior muscle and the intercostal muscles. Early studies suggest that it may provide wide pain relief, but its effectiveness specifically in thoracotomy patients has not yet been studied.\n\nThis randomized study aims to compare the pain-relieving effects of the serratus posterior superior intercostal plane block with those of the paravertebral block after thoracotomy. The goal is to find out whether this new block can be a safe and effective option for postoperative pain management."

Considering the presence of national specificities in the management of CTEPH patients, coupled with the relatively low prevalence of the disease, which poses challenges for data accumulation and research, new registry POLET (Registry of Patients with chrOnic thombomboLic pumonary hypErTension) is established to investigate CTEPH patients in real-world clinical practice.\n\nRegistry Aim:\n\nTo investigate the prognosis of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension based on demographic, anamnestic, clinical characteristics, and treatment regimens.\n\nRegistry Objectives:\n\nTo describe the key demographic, anamnestic, and clinical characteristics of CTEPH patients in Russia.\n\nTo identify factors influencing the frequency of hospitalizations due to clinical deterioration in CTEPH patients.\n\nTo determine the impact of anamnestic data and treatment regimens on patient prognosis (time to clinical deterioration/death).\n\nTo determine the impact of demographic and clinical characteristics on patient survival and prognosis (time to clinical deterioration/death).\n\nCurrently, preliminary retrospective data have been collected on 300 CTEPH patients, each with 1 to 15 hospitalizations at the National Medical Research Center of Cardiology named after Academician E.I. Chazov of the Ministry of Health of Russia from 2012-2024, and who are eligible for inclusion in the registry. 200 patients will be enrolled prospectively.\n\nThe following data to be extracted from electronic medical records:\n\nMedical History Data; Clinical Characteristics and Results of Investigations and Treatments During Each Patient Hospitalization; Operability Assessment Results; PAH-Specific Therapy, Anticoagulant Therapy, Supportive Therapy: Therapy Adjustment, Doses, Presence of Side Effects; Details of Pulmonary endarterectomy; Details of BPA performed; Patient outcomes including survival. Statistical data processing will be performed using RStudio and the R programming language. Missing data will be handled with imputation approach."

Proposed dose cohorts include: Cohort 1 , Cohort 2 , Cohort 3 , Cohort 4, Cohort 5 , Cohort 6 , and Cohort 7. Scientific review committee (SRC) will be established to review the data in a blinded manner to confirm whether to proceed with the next cohort and determine the dose for the next cohort according to both protocol and data obtained from previous cohorts. Administration of higher dose cohorts will only be allowed when the safety and tolerability of the lower dose cohorts have been established and are acceptable. SRC composes representatives from the Sponsor (including but not limited to medical responsible, statistician, clinical pharmacologist) and investigator(s). External consultant may be invited as SRC member per specific scientific question."

Study data will be collected from secondary data sources across 7 European countries. The study will be conducted as a multi-country, long-term, retrospective, observational database study. Initiators of exenatide will be matched to initiators of non-GLP-1 RA based GLDs (comparator group) based on propensity score and calendar period of study entry. All analyses for pancreatic cancer will be conducted in the matched study population using an \"intention-to-treat\" approach. The study will use information from 8 data sources in 7 European countries (France, Spain, The United Kingdom, Finland, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden). Patients with T2DM, aged 18 years or older, who initiated treatment with exenatide or non-GLP-1 RA based GLDs during the study period, 2006 to 2023, will be included. Exposure to exenatide and non-GLP-1 RA based GLDs will be ascertained from recordings of prescriptions or insurance claims registrations as available in the different data sources. The outcome of pancreatic cancer will be defined as a primary diagnosis of pancreatic cancer during follow-up."

However, the reliability of the screening depends on the quality of the equipment, the operator's level of expertise, and adherence to protocols that define the necessary scans.\n\nIn France, since the first reports of the National Technical Committee on Prenatal Screening Ultrasound (2005), particular attention has been paid to standardizing practices. More recently, the French National Conference on Obstetric and Fetal Ultrasound (CNEOF) published new recommendations (2022, revised in 2023) including the development of reference silhouettes for the second-trimester examination, proposing 26 views (22 required and 4 additional). However, the CNEOF does not formalize quality criteria for evaluating the conformity of these images; this task has been taken over by the French College of Fetal Ultrasound (CFEF), which has established a scoring and validation grid for each fetal slice (see CFEF 2022 document).\n\nIn parallel, artificial intelligence (AI) is gradually becoming established as a decision support and automation tool in medical imaging, particularly in ultrasound. Deep learning algorithms are capable of identifying anatomical structures, positioning measurement markers, and selecting the most optimal slice, reducing inter-operator variability and streamlining workflow. In the field of obstetric ultrasound, some companies have launched systems capable of detecting or annotating fetal structures in real time, potentially improving diagnostic reliability and reproducibility. Samsung has developed a system called Live View Assist, available on its latest generation ultrasound scanners, which uses AI to automatically recognize and freeze the required fetal slices in real time.\n\nThe tool also offers automated validation: if the detected slice conforms to the expected standards, it is directly checked off on a checklist. This innovation promises time savings, a reduced risk of missing certain complex slices, and improved standardization.\n\nHowever, there is little data, particularly in France, regarding to the actual performance of this tool in a routine screening context. Before considering the integration of Live View Assist and AI into daily practice, it is therefore essential to evaluate the quality of the images it acquires, the feasibility of a complete examination assisted by AI, as well as the potential impact on examination time and improvement of the workload for sonographers.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate whether the quality of the 20 mandatory images automatically validated by Live View Assist is not inferior to that of the 20 mandatory images acquired and validated manually by an ultrasound technician, according to the CFEF quality criteria based on the silhouettes recommended by the CNEOF."

Although this has been shown in studies to be beneficial in other conditions, for instance dental work and after surgery, it has not been shown to further improve pain in people with cancer-related pain. Taking tablets is burdensome to patients and the study aims to determine whether the inconvenience of taking eight extra paracetamol tablets per day can be justified.\n\nThe study plans to show whether or not pain control is changed (non-inferior) when stopping paracetamol compared to continued use of paracetamol in people already taking strong pain killers for cancer-related pain. Voluntary participants who are taking a combination of paracetamol and a strong opioid are recruited to the study."

          "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to see if repeat bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccinations can confer a beneficial immune and metabolic effect on Type 1 diabetes. Published Phase I data on repeat BCG vaccinations in long term diabetics showed specific death of some of the disease causing bad white blood cells and also showed a short and small pancreas effect of restored insulin secretion. In this Phase II study, the investigators will attempt to vaccinate more frequently to see if these desirable effects can be more sustained.\n\nEligible volunteers will either be vaccinated with BCG in a repeat fashion over a period of four years, or receive a placebo treatment. The investigators hypothesize that each BCG vaccination will eliminate more and more of the disease causing white blood cells that could offer relief to the pancreas for increased survival and restoration of insulin secretion from the pancreas.\n\nAn additional adaptive trial for COVID-19 is also being conducted on these randomized double blinded type 1 diabetic subjects receiving BCG or placebo injections.\n\nAn expanded study arm has been approved for repeat dosing of BCG in adult Type I diabetes."

          "briefSummary": "This study aims to evaluate whether a single oral dose of nicotinamide riboside (NR), a precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), has acute effects on sleep in healthy adults who report mild sleep difficulties. NR is widely used as a nutritional supplement and is known to increase cellular NAD+ levels, which may influence physiological processes linked to sleep-wake regulation.\n\nIn this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 20 healthy adults will complete two overnight sleep assessments using polysomnography (PSG), the gold-standard sleep monitoring method. After a baseline night of sleep recording, participants will receive either NR or a placebo before bedtime on the second night. Researchers will compare sleep duration and sleep structure before and after the intervention to determine whether NR has an acute effect on objective sleep quality.\n\nThe study will also evaluate safety and collect participants' subjective sleep impressions. Findings may help clarify whether NR, a widely used nutritional supplement, has measurable short-term effects on human sleep.",
          "detailedDescription": "Sleep quality is a major component of overall health, yet many adults experience mild but persistent sleep difficulties. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a naturally occurring precursor of NAD+, a key coenzyme involved in cellular energy metabolism and circadian regulation. Preclinical studies suggest that NR may influence neural pathways related to sleep-wake control, but its short-term, objective effects on human sleep architecture have not been well established.\n\nThis study is designed to explore the acute impact of NR on objectively measured sleep in healthy adults with mild subjective sleep complaints. It uses a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design to minimize bias. All participants will spend two consecutive nights in a controlled sleep laboratory. The first night serves as a baseline assessment of natural sleep. On the second night, individuals will receive a single 600 mg dose of NR or a matched placebo one hour before bedtime.\n\nPolysomnography (PSG) will be used to evaluate total sleep time, sleep stages, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and wakefulness during the night. Subjective sleep quality will be assessed with validated questionnaires administered the morning after each sleep recording. Safety will be monitored throughout the study period and through a follow-up contact after discharge.This exploratory early-phase study aims to generate objective human data regarding the feasibility, safety, and potential sleep-modulating effects of NR."

          "briefSummary": "Recently, large clinical intervention studies have demonstrated the cardiovascular protective effects on of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) such as empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin in reduction of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, coincident with a significant reduction in heart failure hospitalizations. Therefore, SGLT2i had been recommended as a therapeutic drug for diabetic patients to reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular events. However, the mechanism of these benefits remains unclear at the present time.\n\nMyocardial fibrosis is not only an important physiopathological mechanism of heart failure, but also has been shown to be closely associated with the risk of heart failure-related hospitalization and death, especially in patients with T2D. However, whether SGLT2i can exert cardioprotective effects by improving myocardial fibrosis remains to be further investigated. In recent years, the development of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) technology enables to detect focal and diffuse fibrosis in myocardial tissue, which makes it possible to systematically explore the role of SGLT2i on myocardial fibrosis. Although several studies including EMPA-HEART, SUGAR-DM-HF have explored the effects of SGLT2i on cardiac structure and function, these studies didn't reach consistent results. In addition, more scarce studies have investigated the effects of SGLT2i on both focal and diffuse fibrosis. At present, whether SGLT2i treatment can change the relevant indicators of myocardial fibrosis in people with diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors has not yet been reported. In addition, previous studies mainly focus on empagliflozin and dapagliflozin, and studies on canagliflozin are still very scarce. Therefore, this study intends to explore the effects of canagliflozin on myocardial fibrosis and other structures and functions of the heart in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular risk factors.",
          "detailedDescription": "According to the International Federation for Diabetes, diabetes now affects approximately 9.3% of the population worldwide, and the prevalence over the next two decades will continue to increase, reaching 552 million by 2030. In particular, type 2 diabetes (T2D) can cause macrovascular and microvascular complications, for example, T2D can increase the risks of ischemic stroke by 72% and stable angina by 62%. In addition, the incidence of heart failure in T2D patients is 9-22%, 2-4 times that of the general population. A significant breakthrough in contemporary cardiology was the finding that sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are associated with a lower risk of heart failure (HF) Hospitalization in patients with or at high risk of CV disease. In the EMPAREG OUTCOME Trial, Empagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death and hospitalisation for heart failure (HF) by 38% and 35%, respectively, with an almost immediate beneficial effect despite only a modest difference in glycaemic control, comparing two study arms over 94 weeks. The reductions in CV death were not accounted for by the reductions in atherothrombotic outcomes, as the rates of myocardial infarction and stroke remained unchanged with therapy. The proposed theory that HF is the outcome most sensitive to SGLT2 inhibition was confirmed in the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) Program and Dapagliflozin DECLARE-TIMI 58 trials. More recently, the EMPEROR trial showed that SGLT2 inhibition reduces the risk of hospitalisation for HF in patients regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes. The mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors cause the reduction in HF risks and cardiovascular mortality are yet unknown.\n\nMyocardial fibrosis is not only an important physiopathological mechanism of heart failure, but also has been shown to be closely associated with the risk of heart failure-related hospitalization and death, especially in patients with T2D. However, whether SGLT2i can exert cardioprotective effects by improving myocardial fibrosis remains to be further investigated. In recent years, the development of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) technology enables to detect focal and diffuse fibrosis in myocardial tissue, which makes it possible to systematically explore the role of SGLT2i on myocardial fibrosis.\n\nAt present, relevant studies have explored the effects of SGLT2i on cardiac structure and function. For example, there have been several related studies on left ventricular structure and function, but no consistent conclusions have been drawn: for example, the EMPA-HEART study showed that empagliflozin can reduce left ventricular mass; DAPA-HEART The LVH and SUGAR-DM-HF studies clarified the effect of dapagliflozin in reducing left ventricular mass and end-systolic volume; the REFORM study did not find that dapagliflozin had any effect on left ventricular weight. plastic effect. In addition, only the EMPA-HEART study investigated the effect of SGLT2i on both focal and diffuse fibrosis, and found that empagliflozin significantly improved diffuse fibrosis in people with diabetes and coronary heart disease. However, the SUGAR-DM-HF study did not observe changes in diffuse fibrosis with empagliflozin intervention in people with diabetes or prediabetes with reduced ejection fraction. At present, whether SGLT2i treatment can change the relevant indicators of myocardial fibrosis in people with diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors has not yet been reported. In addition, previous studies mainly focus on empagliflozin and dapagliflozin, and studies on canagliflozin are still very scarce. Therefore, this study intends to explore the effects of canagliflozin on myocardial fibrosis and other structures and functions of the heart in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular risk factors."

Researchers are trying to determine what level of proton therapy gives the most benefit without causing toxic side effects. Researchers will also be testing the treatment's effect.\n\nIf your doctor feels it is necessary, the proton beam therapy may be combined with standard photon therapy.\n\nIf you are eligible to take part in this study, you will receive proton beam therapy at The University of Texas (UT) MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), and possibly photon beam, no sooner than 2 weeks after the last surgery to remove the tumor. You will receive proton beam therapy once a day for about 35 treatments (7 weeks). Treatment will be given for 5 days in a row each week (except for Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) at the MDACC Proton Center in Houston. The whole process should take up to 1 hour each day.\n\nThis is an investigational study. The proton beam machine used to deliver treatment is approved by the FDA for patient use. The doses being studied are experimental. About 15 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MDACC."

          "briefSummary": "This retrospective observational study evaluates the prognostic value of the C-reactive protein-albumin-lymphocyte (CALLY) index in adult patients with sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The CALLY index reflects inflammatory, nutritional, and immunologic status and may serve as a predictor of clinical outcomes.\n\nCALLY Index values will be obtained on Day 0, Day 3, and Day 5 of ICU admission using routinely collected laboratory data. The primary objective is to determine the association between CALLY Index values and 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary objectives include assessing the relationship between temporal CALLY changes and the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) within the first 7 days of ICU admission, as well as correlations between the Day-0 CALLY Index and established severity scores such as SOFA and APACHE II.\n\nAs this retrospective study uses existing electronic medical records, no additional procedures or interventions will be performed, and no added risk to patients is involved.",
          "detailedDescription": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection and is frequently associated with multiorgan dysfunction and high mortality. Early identification of patients at increased risk of poor outcomes remains a major challenge in critical care. The C-reactive protein-albumin-lymphocyte (CALLY) Index is a composite biomarker that reflects inflammatory, nutritional, and immune status. Although recent studies have explored the prognostic value of CALLY in critically ill populations, the significance of serial measurements and temporal changes in patients with sepsis has not been fully established.\n\nThis retrospective observational study will include adult patients diagnosed with sepsis according to Sepsis-3 criteria who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between January 2023 and December 2024. The CALLY Index will be calculated using the following formula:\n\nAlbumin (g/L) × lymphocyte count (10⁹/L) × 100 ÷ CRP (mg/L).\n\nCALLY values will be obtained at predefined time points: Day 0 (within 2 hours of ICU admission), Day 3, and Day 5, extracted from the hospital's electronic medical record system.\n\nThe primary aim of the study is to evaluate the association between CALLY Index values and 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary aims include assessing the relationship between temporal changes in CALLY (ΔCALLY₃-₀, ΔCALLY₅-₀, and linear trend slope) and the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) within the first 7 days of ICU admission, as well as examining correlations between the Day-0 CALLY Index and commonly used clinical severity scores, including SOFA and APACHE II.\n\nAll study data will be obtained retrospectively from the hospital's electronic records. No additional tests, procedures, or interventions will be performed. As the study utilizes existing clinical data without influencing patient management, it poses no additional risks to participants. The findings may support improved early risk stratification, monitoring of disease progression, and refinement of prognostic assessment in patients with sepsis."

The primary endpoint of this study is overall response rate (ORR) and the secondary endpoint is progression free survival.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved losartan for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved paclitaxel as a treatment option for this disease. This research study involves screening for eligibility, study treatment with the study drugs, and study visits. Participants will receive study treatment until disease progression, withdrawal, or unacceptable side effects are experienced. Participants that stop study treatment due to disease progression will be followed for 30 days. Participants that stop study treatment due to an unacceptable side effect will have visits and imaging scans every 9 weeks until a different treatment is started. It is expected that about 27 people will take part in this research study."

          "briefSummary": "This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of atosiban in patients with previous pregnancy failure and abnormal uterine contractions during the peri-embryo transfer period in assisted reproductive technology. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does the use of atosiban in patients with a history of implantation failure and abnormal uterine contractions affect the live birth rate in single blastocyst transfer cycles (fresh or frozen-thawed embryo transfer)?\n* Evaluate the differences in efficacy of atosiban regarding perinatal complications and neonatal outcomes, as well as differences in safety concerning miscarriage rates and ectopic pregnancy rates.\n\nResearchers will compare atosiban with placebo (a similar substance containing no active medication) to determine whether atosiban is effective in improving live birth rates from single blastocyst transfer cycles (fresh or frozen-thawed embryo transfer) in patients with a history of implantation failure and abnormal uterine contractions.\n\n* Participants allocated to the Atosiban group will be administered Atosiban (37.5 mg/5 mL, Tractocile®, Ferring Pharma, Geneva, Switzerland) as an intravenous (IV) bolus of 6·75 mg/0.9 mL in 1 minute at 30 minutes prior to the ET procedure, followed by an IV infusion at a rate of 18 mg/h for 1 hour; after 1 hour, the dose of Atosiban will be reduced to 6 mg/h, with a total dose of 37.5 mg. Participants allocated to the placebo group will receive identical-looking saline infusions for the same duration.\n* One hour post-embryo transfer, all randomized participants will be invited to have a reevaluation of uterine wave patterns via ultrasound, performed by the same examiner.\n* Women who had a clinical pregnancy will be subsequently contacted by nurses to document pregnancy events and outcomes at 12 and 24 weeks of gestation, completion of pregnancy, with a follow-up approximately 6 weeks post-delivery. Those participants who had a negative pregnancy test will not be followed up any further as part of this trial."

          "briefSummary": "This study seeks to address the urgent need for theoretically and empirically informed interventions that would address the increasing numbers of unaccompanied minors migrating from rural to urban centers in developing countries for better economic opportunities. This process often results in hazardous child labor defined as work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful; interfering with schooling and health and mental health functioning, and leading to several other disproportionate risks. Unaccompanied migrant child laborers' vulnerability is further intensified by the lack of parental protection and community belonging in the host urban center. The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that 9.6% of children (ages 5 to 17) across the globe are child laborers and draws attention to migrant child laborers as an underreported and highly vulnerable group, a significant portion of which are female with no education. Poverty has been identified as the main driver of child labor, with family context also being a critical contributing factor. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the highest rates of child labor (24%), with Ghana -the focus of this study- registering one of the highest child labor prevalence at 22%, including unaccompanied child migrant laborers. In Ghana, unaccompanied adolescent girls migrate from the Northern region to urban centers in the south to work in the informal economy. Load carrying is the most common type of labor for this population and exposes migrant girls to multiple developmental and health risks. Building on the recently concluded R21 study (with 97 adolescent girls aged 11 to 14 years and their caregivers) that showed high feasibility and acceptability, and promising preliminary impact of the ANZANSI (resilience in Dagbani -local language) combination intervention in the same region, we propose to test its effectiveness in a larger two-arm cluster randomized clinical trial among 960 adolescent girls (age 11 to 14 years) at risk of school dropout nested within 32 public junior high schools in the Northern region of Ghana and their caregivers. The schools will be randomly assigned to one of two study conditions: 1) ANZANSI (FEE+MFG) and 2) bolstered usual care. The intervention will be delivered for 12 months, with assessments conducted at baseline and at 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-ups post-intervention initiation. The study specific aims are: Aim 1: Examine the short- and medium-term impacts of ANZANSI intervention on the incidence of unaccompanied migration for child labor (primary outcome), and academic progress and psychosocial outcomes (secondary); Aim 2: Examine the impact of the ANZANSI intervention on potential mechanisms of change at the individual, family, and community levels; Aim 3: Evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness of each intervention condition; and Aim 4: Qualitatively examine participants, facilitators, and school leadership's experiences with the intervention."

The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does the probiotic reduce symptoms such as fullness after meals, bloating, stomach discomfort, and early satiation?\n* Does the probiotic improve emotional well-being, including stress, anxiety, and mood? Researchers will compare the probiotic to a placebo (a look-alike capsule with no active ingredients) to see if the probiotic truly helps adults with functional dyspepsia.\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Take one capsule of the probiotic or placebo once daily before meals for 60 days\n* Complete questionnaires about their digestive symptoms at the start, 1 month, and 2 months\n* Complete surveys on stress, anxiety, depression, and quality of life at the start and 2 months\n* Attend scheduled study visits for checkups and assessments"

          "briefSummary": "This phase II trial compares the effect of atezolizumab in combination with usual treatment with cabozantinib to cabozantinib alone in patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is a type of kidney cancer that forms in the lining of the tiny tubes in the kidney that return filtered substances that the body needs back to the blood and remove extra fluid and waste as urine. Most papillary tumors look like long, thin finger-like growths under a microscope. It is also called papillary kidney cancer or PRCC. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cabozantinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals tumor cells to multiply and may also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. By these actions it may help slow or stop the spread of tumor cells. Combination therapy with atezolizumab and cabozantinib may shrink the tumor and allow a longer survival time in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.",
          "detailedDescription": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare progression-free survival in participants with metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma (mPRCC) randomized to cabozantinib (cabozantinib S-malate) with atezolizumab versus cabozantinib alone.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare overall survival in participants with mPRCC randomized to cabozantinib with atezolizumab versus cabozantinib alone.\n\nII. To compare Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) objective response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial response) in participants with mPRCC randomized to cabozantinib with atezolizumab versus cabozantinib alone.\n\nIII. To evaluate the quantitative and qualitive adverse events observed in each treatment arm.\n\nBANKING OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To bank biospecimens for future correlative studies.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive cabozantinib S-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and blood and urine sample collection throughout the trial. Patients may also undergo bone scan throughout the trial.\n\nARM II: Patients receive cabozantinib S-malate PO QD on days 1-21 and atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo CT scan or MRI and blood and urine sample collection throughout the trial. Patients may also undergo bone scan throughout the trial.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for up to 5 years."

          "briefSummary": "Background:\n\nThe adrenal glands are 2 small organs that sit on top of each kidney. They release hormones; these are chemicals that control how the body works. Tumors on or outside the adrenal glands are called functional if they release hormones; they are called nonfunctional if they do not. Doctors who treat adrenal tumors need to know which type a person has. Researchers want to find better ways to learn whether an adrenal tumor is functional.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo see if a new radioactive tracer (\\[68Ga\\]Ga-PentixaFor) can make it easier to identify functional adrenal tumors with positron emission tomography (PET) scans.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPeople aged 18 years and older with 1 or more adrenal tumors. They must have increased levels of the hormones aldosterone or cortisol. They must also be enrolled in at least 1 other related NIH study (protocols 19-DK-0066, 18-CH-0031, or 09-C-0242).\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened. They may have imaging scans. Their ability to perform normal activities will be reviewed.\n\nParticipants will have one PET scan with the study tracer.\n\nThe tracer will be given through a tube attached to a needle inserted into a vein. Participants will receive the tracer 1 hour before the scan. They will lie still on a bed while a machine captures images of the inside of their body. The scan will take 45 to 90 minutes.\n\nParticipants heart rate, blood pressure, and rate of breathing will be checked before, during, and after the scan.\n\nParticipants will have a follow-up visit 3 days after their scan. This visit can be by phone, email, or in person.",
          "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\n* \\[68Ga\\]Ga-PentixaFor is a PET agent targeting the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) with promising applications in oncology, cardiology, and infectious disease.\n* CXCR4 has also been noted to show high expression in many aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA) and some cortisol-producing adenomas (CPA) but not usually in nonfunctioning adenomas.\n* \\[68Ga\\]Ga-PentixaFor may be useful in the evaluation of adrenal adenomas in the setting of Conn's or Cushing's syndrome. Localizing functional adenomas is important for managing treatment options but current imaging modalities are either too invasive or insufficiently able to differentiate adrenal conditions.\n\nObjective:\n\n-To estimate the percent concordance of \\[68Ga\\]Ga-PentixaFor imaging with clinical diagnosis in identifying functional adrenal or extra-adrenal adenomas in hyperaldosteronism and hypercortisolism\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Must have any of the following:\n\n  * one or more adrenal masses on CT and/or MRI and biochemical evidence of excess aldosterone or\n  * ACTH-independent hypercortisolism with or without adrenal masses on CT and/or MRI or\n  * history of ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism (with or without adrenal enlargement)\n* Age \\>= 18 years\n* ECOG performance status \\<= 2\n\nDesign:\n\n* This is a Phase II, single site study where participants from three cohorts are enrolled into one arm according to their probable disease: primary aldosteronism (Cohort 1), ACTHindependent Cushing's syndrome (Cohort 2), or ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome (Cohort 3).\n* All participants will undergo a \\[68Ga\\]Ga-PentixaFor PET/CT or \\[68Ga\\]Ga-PentixaFor PET/MR.\n* A safety visit will be performed 3 days following the \\[68Ga\\]Ga-PentixaFor imaging.\n* Participants will remain on-study for up to 1 year to allow the collection of samples for correlative analysis from the parent protocol (adrenal venous sampling, imaging assessments, laboratory evaluations, and/or tissue samples)."

          "briefSummary": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of a fixed dose of 3.66 mcg of follitropin delta (Rekovelle) on ovarian response during ovarian stimulation for intrauterine insemination (IUI). The assumption is that this fixed dose will be effective while minimizing the risk of multiple pregnancies. A recent study demonstrated the efficacy of follitropin delta for ovarian stimulation in IUI, and it has been approved in France for controlled ovarian stimulation in assisted reproductive techniques such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and IVF with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). With an adapted dose of Rekovelle for patients with regular menstrual cycles, ovarian stimulation is optimized from the first attempt, promoting the development of two follicles to improve pregnancy chances while reducing the risk of multiple pregnancies. This approach aims to achieve pregnancy faster and provide a more comfortable treatment experience.",
          "detailedDescription": "Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a frequently used step in the management of unexplained infertility or mild fertility disorders. In normal-weight patients, the main objective of ovarian stimulation in IUI is to obtain a controlled ovarian response, ideally bifollicular.\n\nMoreover, the main risks currently associated with IUI are multiple pregnancies and iatrogenic complications (cycle cancellation due to insufficient response or excessive response to stimulation more than 3 follicles). It is therefore essential to optimize stimulation treatment protocols to ensure IUI under the best possible conditions.\n\nDue to a precise dose adjustment with Follitropin Delta, the product used in the study (REKOVELLE), for normo-ovulatory patient, an optimal response (bifollicular response) is expected for the majority of patients from the first stimulation. This goal will also facilitate quicker pregnancy attainment and reduce the risk of drop-out and insémination annulation The hypothesis is that this dosage would be efficient and also minimize the risk of multiple pregnancies During the screening visit, the investigator checks the patient's eligibility and informs her about the RISE study. At the inclusion visit, written informed consent is obtained, and the Rekovelle® treatment is explained and initiated. Monitoring visits start on day 9 and then every 2 days until two mature follicles develop. Ovocyte maturation is triggered with an hCG injection, followed by insemination 36 hours later, performed according to routine care. Follow-up visits occur at 6-8 weeks and 13 weeks post-insemination."
