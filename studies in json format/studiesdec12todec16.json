          "detailedDescription": "Calcified lesions posed a significant challenge in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The existence of calcified plaque increased the difficulty of optimal stent expansion and the risk of target lesion failure(TLF). Consequently, optimizing the preparation techniques for calcified lesions before stent implantation has assumed growing importance.\n\nAs a kind of novel double-layered balloon, super high-pressure balloon can expand uniformly under extreme pressure. Previous studies have demonstrated that super high-pressure balloon perform non-inferiorly or superiorly to other strategies in terms of final stent expansion.\n\nThrough triggering localized pulsatile sonic pressure, intravascular lithotripsy(IVL) cracked intimal and medial calcium plaque within the artery. In present series of studies(DISRUPT), the optimized preparation of calcified lesions with IVL has been proved to be safe and effective. According to guidelines and clinical practice, IVL is applicable to different types of severe calcification lesions, including concentric and eccentric calcifications. However, considering its technological and economic costs, finding other preparation techniques non-inferiority to IVL was essential. In clinical practice, super high-pressure balloon had shown considerable effects of preparation for calcified lesions. However, study focused on the comparison of super high-pressure balloon with IVL for severe calcified lesions was limited.\n\nIn summary, this randomized trial aimed to evaluate the stent expansion through optical coherence tomography (OCT) among individuals underwent different preparation techniques ,then comparing the efficacy and safety of super high-pressure balloon to IVL in severely calcified lesions"

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate whether new imaging techniques can help us to better understand the cardiac amyloidosis. The disease can be slowed down with various medications (e.g., tafamidis, acoramidis, or vutrisiran). However, treatment is not effective in all patients-in about one-third of cases, the disease continues to progress. So far, we know little about the exact causes of this and what biological changes occur in the heart muscle.\n\nThe main question it aims to answer is:\n\nWill new imaging techniques help us understand the course of the cardiac amyloidosis?\n\nParticipants will have additional examinations:\n\n* At the beginning of the study: one additional heart ultrasound examination, one cardiac MRI and one cardiac PET, blood examination during the regular examination, questionnaires.\n* After a year: one additional heart ultrasound examination, one cardiac MRI and one cardiac PET, blood examination during the regular examination.\n\nTime required:\n\n* Heart ultrasound examination: 5-10 Minutes\n* Cardiac MRI: 2 hours\n* Cardiac PET: 2 hours\n* Questionnaires: 5-10 Minutes.",
          "detailedDescription": "Experimental Design The study design is an open label prospective longitudinal study with serial imaging at baseline and after 12-month follow-up. The entire study population will include 50 participants with cardiac ATTR amyloidosis, as recently defined by multi-societal criteria.\n\nConventional markers of disease progression\n\nThese markers are collected during routine clinical follow-up of patients in our Outpatient Clinic. The markers are divided into three domains and include the following outcomes:\n\n* Clinical and functional: any heart failure hospitalization, NYHA class, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, 6-minute walk test;\n* Laboratory biomarkers: NT-proBNP, troponin, creatinine;\n* Imaging and ECG: LV wall thickness, diastolic dysfunction, LVEF, stroke volume, global longitudinal strain, conduction disturbance.\n\nData Analysis Plan Power calculation for sample size is challenging as no previous study has evaluated the response of our endpoints in myocardial FAPI uptake or serum BMP4 concentration to tafamidis. We therefore focused sample size calculation of echocardiographic myocardial stiffness. Based on our own preliminary data, we estimate median baseline values for myocardial stiffness of 2.6 m/s \\[IQR, 1.7-3.8\\] in cardiac amyloidosis. Disease progression is expected in about 30% of participants. While myocardial stiffness is expected to remain unchanged in cardiac amyloidosis without disease progression a 20% relative increase (i.e. 0.5 ± 0.5 m/s) is considered in cardiac amyloidosis with disease progression. A sample size of 40 participants (i.e. 30 participants without and 10 participants with disease progression) has a statistical power of 80% to predict a difference in response of myocardial stiffness to tafamidis.\n\nNon-normally distributed, paired data of repeated measures (i.e. longitudinal changes per group) are compared by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Non-normally distributed unpaired data of changes (i.e. longitudinal changes between groups) are compared by Mann-Whitney test. The correlations are compared by a z-test on Fisher z-transformed correlation coefficients."

The investigators hypothesize that DRIVESC can detect measurable changes in driving-related cognitive and motor performance across blood alcohol concentrations up to the U.S. per se legal limit of 0.08% g/210L ethanol. The study will enroll healthy adults aged 18-64 years (including both dosed and zero-alcohol arms) participating in the Wisconsin Breath Alcohol Examiner Specialist course, with each participant completing two study visits over two days.",
          "detailedDescription": "A total of 18-22 participants will be enrolled in this single-site partial crossover pilot study. Under the auspices of the Wisconsin Basic Breath Examiner Specialist training, participants will be dosed with alcohol on the first, second, or neither day of the three-day training.\n\nThis study design includes 6 double-alcohol-negative participants who will complete two days of alcohol-negative study tasks. The investigators will consider enrolling 12 alcohol-positive participants a success but are aiming to enroll 16 alcohol-positive participants. Alcohol-positive participants will complete two days of study tasks where one day is alcohol-negative and the other day is alcohol-positive. The order of positive-negative and negative-positive will be balanced. This range allows for flexibility in this feasibility study as study activities are scheduled in coordination with and around Chemical Testing Section training activities to minimize disruption to their educational tasks."

These miRs will be used to characterize the overall immune state in adult heart transplant patients and predict patients that will go on to develop infection and rejection. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression and serve as molecular biomarkers found in the circulation.",

Patients will be screened for eligibility and enrolled \\~1 month (± 2 weeks) after transplant. Study participation will last 36 months.\n\nAll patients will follow the center's standard of care surveillance schedule after transplant. Blood samples will be collected for miR evaluation at:\n\n1. specified time intervals after transplant and\n2. when a clinical event of interest occurs, including treated rejection, or infection.\n\nResearch samples will be collected and used to evaluate miR expression as well as other biomarkers related to heart transplantation and immunosuppression medications. Additional data collection will include demographics, medical history, medications, human leukocyte (HLA)/donor specific antibody (DSA) evaluations, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) echocardiography, donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA), and other post-transplant events and testing.\n\nThis work will form the basis for a non-invasive, genomic blood test that can be used to monitor patients after heart transplant to mitigate complications of over-immunosuppression, such as infection, without increasing the risks of under-immunosuppression, such as rejection."

Seventy-four patients were assessed between 2014 and 2023. Patients with identifiable structural pathology underwent lesion-specific surgical correction, while those without detectable lesions but with neuropathic nocturnal pain underwent decompression of the median nerve. Pain intensity was measured using the visual analogue scale (VAS) preoperatively, at 10-12 days, and at three months. The study aims to determine the speed and magnitude of pain improvement after targeted surgical intervention.",
          "detailedDescription": "Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a multifactorial neuropathic pain disorder that can occur after trauma or surgery and is often resistant to conservative treatment. Increasing evidence suggests that in a subset of patients, peripheral mechanical factors contribute significantly to symptom generation. This prospective clinical study evaluated the outcomes of targeted surgical treatment in patients with CRPS of the upper limb who met the Budapest diagnostic criteria.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2023, seventy-four patients were examined. Thirty-eight patients presented with identifiable structural pathology, such as hardware impingement, neuroma, tendon adhesion, or scar tethering, and underwent lesion-specific surgical correction. Thirty-six patients had no detectable structural lesion but reported nocturnal neuropathic pain suggestive of median nerve irritation; these patients underwent decompression of the median nerve. Pain intensity was measured using the visual analogue scale (VAS) before surgery, at suture removal (10-12 days), and at three months postoperatively.\n\nPatients with identifiable mechanical pathology demonstrated substantial improvement, with an average 7.2-point VAS reduction after six months. Patients who underwent median nerve decompression showed rapid and marked pain reduction, improving by 7.1 points within 10-12 days and 8.6 points within three months. Acute CRPS cases improved more than chronic ones, indicating an early therapeutic window before central sensitization becomes dominant. Only one chronic case failed to improve. The results suggest that timely surgical assessment and correction of peripheral nerve or soft-tissue factors may lead to rapid and significant clinical recovery in selected CRPS patients."

          "briefSummary": "Hypermobile EDS and hypermobile spectrum disorder (collectively referred to as hEDS) are estimated to affect 1 in 500 individuals worldwide. hEDS patients have limited treatment options for their numerous symptoms that impact the quality of life. This clinical trial tests a new ear stimulation method in hEDS patients to determine if it may improve quality of life.",
          "detailedDescription": "The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of heritable, connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility2. Hypermobile EDS (hEDS) is the most common type of EDS and is estimated to affect 1 in 500 individuals worldwide1. Note that there are specific clinical criteria for hEDS and those who do not meet all of them but have a number of similar symptoms are usually classified with hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD). When investigators use the term hEDS investigators include those with HSD as well. hEDS is characterized by broad tissue/organ involvement across multiple systems and incomplete penetrance. Of particular interest for the proposed work, the vagus nerve has afferent and efferent interactions with nearly all of the affected systems (i.e., cardiovascular, GI, immune system, neurologic function). hEDS is a chronic and debilitating disease that oftentimes begins during childhood and worsens at the time of puberty3. In general, hEDS affects women more severely than men and they are more frequently diagnosed. Treatment options are limited to symptom management and may include physical therapy, bracing and mobility aids, pain management and medication for co-morbid conditions. Surgical intervention is frequent in hEDS patients with an average of 4-5 surgeries required prior to the age of 25 and some are left bed bound and severely handicapped. According to recent reports, 50% of hEDS patients have considered suicide due to not only chronic pain, depression and surgeries, but sadly due to physician-patient interactions being dismissive.\n\nhEDS is viewed as the most neglected disease in modern medicine. The healthcare burden is significant with annual costs estimated at \\~$100K/year/patient with a total cost of $3-10M over a lifetime per patient. Physicians are taught limited and misleading information in medical school that Ehlers Danlos Syndromes are benign and rare diseases. These education deficiencies combined with phenotype heterogeneity result in diagnostic challenges. Consequentially, the average time to diagnosis from first symptoms is 14 years. The proposed studies in this application are an important step in transforming how the disease is viewed and understood in the medical community and will provide hope to the many patients with hEDS.\n\nAs there is little known about the etiology of the multi-system dysfunction and co-morbidities in hEDS, investigators propose an exploratory study of wide breadth to search for the most promising follow-up investigations. To that end, our main goal is to establish a human trial to investigate the effect of hEDS on multiple body systems and the potentially beneficial effects of an intervention known to have effects on most of those same body systems (vagus nerve stimulation - VNS). Investigators propose to advance mechanistic understanding of hEDS and to test a new therapeutic approach.\n\nSpecific Aim: Investigate whether 4 weeks of at-home transcutaneous auricular VNS (tAN) improves a battery of nine key physical and psychological symptoms of a group of hEDS patients (n=36) using an open-label active only design. Investigators will remotely collect clinical measures at baseline, and weekly timepoints through week 4, as well as a 3 month follow up. Investigators will test patients in the following domains: pain, fatigue, sleep, anxiety, depression, quality of life, GI function, immune function and autonomic function."

Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either of 2 treatment groups as follows:\n\n* Talazoparib in combination with enzalutamide.\n* Placebo capsules identical in appearance to talazoparib capsules in combination with enzalutamide.\n\nTalazoparib or identical placebo treatment will be blinded. Enzalutamide (160 mg/day) will be open label. The dose of talazoparib/placebo to be given in combination with enzalutamide is 0.5 mg once daily. Participants with moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 by the MDRD equation) at screening may be enrolled and the talazoparib/placebo dose will be 0.35 mg once daily."

Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation, small cell or signet cell features. If the participant does not have a prior histological diagnosis, a baseline de novo biopsy must be used to confirm the diagnosis and may also be used to support biomarker analysis.\n3. Confirmation of DDR gene mutation status by prospective or historical analysis (with sponsor pre-approval) of blood (liquid biopsy) and/or de novo or archival tumor tissue using FoundationOne Liquid CDx or FoundationOne CDx.\n4. Willing to provide tumor tissue when available (de novo or archived) for retrospective molecular profiling analysis, if not already provided as part of inclusion criterion 3.\n5. Unless prohibited by local regulations or ethics committee decision, consent to a saliva sample collection for retrospective sequencing of the same DDR genes tested on tumor tissue and blood (liquid biopsy), or a subset thereof, and to serve as a germline control in identifying tumor mutations.\n6. Ongoing ADT with a GnRH agonist or antagonist for participants who have not undergone bilateral orchiectomy must be initiated before randomization and must continue throughout the study.\n7. Metastatic prostate cancer documented by positive bone scan (for bone disease) or metastatic lesions on CT or MRI scan (for soft tissue). Participants whose disease spread is limited to regional pelvic lymph nodes are not eligible. Note: a finding of superscan at baseline is exclusionary.\n8. Prior treatment of mCSPC with docetaxel is not permitted.\n9. Treatment with estrogens, cyproterone acetate, or first-generation anti-androgens is allowed until randomization.\n10. Other prior therapy allowed for mCSPC; ≤3 months of ADT (chemical or surgical) with or without approved NHT in mCSPC (ie, abiraterone + prednisone, apalutamide, or enzalutamide), if required prior to randomization, with no radiographic evidence of disease progression or rising PSA levels prior to Day 1.\n11. Participant may have received palliative radiation or surgery for symptomatic control secondary to prostate cancer, which should have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to randomization. NOTE: Radical prostatectomy or definitive radiotherapy to the primary tumor for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer with curative intent is not permitted.\n12. ECOG performance status 0 or 1.\n13. Adequate organ function within 28 days before the first study treatment on Day 1, defined by the following:\n\n    * ANC ≥1500/µL, platelets ≥100,000/µL, or hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (may not have received growth factors or blood transfusions within 14 days before obtaining the hematology laboratory tests at screening).\n    * Total serum bilirubin \\<1.5 × ULN (\\<3 × ULN for participants with documented Gilbert syndrome or for whom indirect bilirubin concentrations suggest an extrahepatic source of elevation).\n    * AST or ALT \\<2.5 × ULN (\\<5 × ULN if liver function abnormalities are due to hepatic metastasis).\n    * Albumin \\>2.8 g/dL.\n    * eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 by the MDRD equation.\n14. Sexually active participants that in the opinion of the investigator are capable of ejaculating, must agree to use a condom when having sex with a partner (female or male) from the time of the first dose of study treatment through 4 months after last dose of study treatment (or, if talazoparib/placebo has been stopped more than a month earlier than enzalutamide, through 3 months after last dose of enzalutamide). Must also agree for female partner of childbearing potential to use an additional highly effective form of contraception from the time of the first dose of study treatment through 4 months after last dose of study treatment (or, if talazoparib / placebo has been stopped more than a month earlier than enzalutamide, through 3 months after last dose of enzalutamide) when having sex.\n15. Must agree not to donate sperm from the first dose of study treatment to 4 months after the last dose of study treatment (or, if talazoparib/placebo has been stopped more than a month earlier than enzalutamide, through 3 months after last dose of enzalutamide).\n16. Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures, including being able to manage electronic diaries. The PRO assessments are not required to be completed if a patient does not understand the language(s) available for a specific questionnaire and/or cannot complete the specific questionnaire independently.\n17. Capable of giving signed informed consent.\n18. For France only: Participants affiliated with the social security system or beneficiaries of an equivalent system.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Other acute or chronic medical (concurrent disease, infection, including chronic stable HIV, HBV, or HCV infection, or co-morbidity) or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation/behavior or laboratory abnormality that interferes with a participant's ability to participate in the study, may increase the risk of associated with study participation or study treatment administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and, in the investigator's judgment, make the participant inappropriate for entry into the study. HIV/HBV/HCV testing is not required unless mandated by local health authority.\n2. History of seizure or any condition (as assessed by investigator) that may predispose to seizure (eg, prior cortical stroke, significant brain trauma), including any history of loss of consciousness or transient ischemic attack within 12 months of randomization.\n3. Major surgery (as defined by the investigator) within 4 weeks before randomization.\n4. Known or suspected brain metastasis or active leptomeningeal disease.\n5. Symptomatic or impending spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.\n6. Any history of MDS, AML, or prior malignancy except for the following:\n\n   * Carcinoma in situ or non-melanoma skin cancer.\n   * A cancer diagnosed and treated ≥3 years before randomization with no subsequent evidence of recurrence.\n   * American Joint Committee on Cancer Stage 0 or Stage 1 cancer \\<3 years before randomization that has a remote probability of recurrence in the opinion of the investigator and the sponsor.\n7. In the opinion of the investigator, any clinically significant gastrointestinal disorder affecting absorption.\n8. Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, including any of the following:\n\n   * Myocardial infarction or symptomatic cardiac ischemia within 6 months before randomization.\n   * Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association class III or IV.\n   * History of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (eg, sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsade de pointes) within 1 year before screening.\n   * History of Mobitz II second degree or third-degree heart block unless a permanent pacemaker is in place.\n   * Hypotension as indicated by systolic blood pressure \\<86 mm Hg at screening.\n   * Bradycardia as indicated by a heart rate of \\<45 beats per minute on the screening electrocardiogram.\n   * Uncontrolled hypertension as indicated by systolic blood pressure \\>170 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure \\>105 mm Hg at screening. However, participants can be rescreened after adequate control of blood pressure is achieved.\n9. Active COVID-19 infection detected by viral test or based on clinical diagnosis (as assessed by investigator). Asymptomatic participants with no active COVID-19 infection detected but positive antibody tests, indicating past infection are allowed.\n10. Prior ADT in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting, where the completion of ADT was less than 12 months prior to randomization and the total duration of ADT exceeded 36 months.\n11. Participant received treatment with systemic glucocorticoids greater than the equivalent of 10 mg per day of prednisone within 4 weeks prior to randomization, intended for the treatment of prostate cancer.\n12. Any previous treatment with DNA-damaging cytotoxic chemotherapy (ie, platinum based therapy) within 5 years prior to randomization, except for indications other than prostate cancer.\n13. Prior treatment with a PARPi, or known or possible hypersensitivity to enzalutamide, any of enzalutamide capsule excipients or to any talazoparib/placebo capsule excipients.\n14. Prior treatment in any setting with NHT, except as described in Inclusion Criterion #10.\n15. Current use of potent P-gp inhibitors within 7 days prior to randomization.\n16. Treatment with any investigational study intervention within 4 weeks before randomization. Exception: COVID-19 vaccines authorized under an emergency use authorization (or equivalent) can be administered without a washout period.\n17. Baseline 12-lead ECG that demonstrates clinically relevant abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results (eg, QTcF interval \\>470 msec, complete LBBB, signs of an acute or indeterminate age myocardial infarction, ST-T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second or third degree AV block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias). If the baseline uncorrected QT interval is \\>470 msec, this interval should be rate-corrected using the Fridericia method and the resulting QTcF should be used for decision making and reporting. If QTc exceeds 470 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility. Computer-interpreted ECGs should be overread by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding participants.\n18. Investigator site staff or Sponsor employees directly involved in the conduct of the study, site staff otherwise supervised by the investigator, and their respective family members.\n19.

Thus we evaluate a community-based mobile phone intervention (mivacunaLA) to assess if there is an increase in vaccination rates among 12-17 year old children and willingness to vaccinate 2-11year old children who have not been previously vaccinated who reside in high-risk and low resourced neighborhoods in Los Angeles.",
          "detailedDescription": "We conducted a community-based randomized clinical trial with a wait list control group among adult Latino parents or caregivers in East and South Los Angeles. Participants completed an online demographic and baseline survey and were randomly assigned to treatment or wait-list control. Based on their preference, participants received a weekly text message or email link twice a week for four weeks (Mon and Wed at noon). Twice a week messages consisted of a short text (\\<160 characters) linking participants to a 2-3 minute video (Monday) and educational text (around 500 words in length. The material was divided into weekly topics regarding the coronavirus vaccine and other topics relevant to the Latino community. Participants were also directed to reliable websites where they could access additional information and links with instructions on where to get vaccinated. Upon completing the intervention, participants completed a 1-month follow-up survey."

          "briefSummary": "The focus of this study is to determine whether adding Whole Health Coaching (WHC) improves pain care among adults with chronic pain and who are currently working with a pain management team (PMT) at the VA.",
          "detailedDescription": "This multisite pragmatic effectiveness-implementation hybrid type 2 trial will randomize 432 patients to compare Pain Management Team - Usual Care (PMT-UC) vs. Pain Management Team Usual Care + Whole Health Coaching (PMT-WHC) on the primary composite outcome of pain-related interference and opioid safety. The investigators will also evaluate the impact of PMT-WHC on buprenorphine initiation and maintenance, evaluate implementation facilitation strategies for building and sustaining PMTs, and conduct a budget impact analysis.\n\nThe primary study goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of adding Whole Health Coaching to PMTs adhering to VA standards on the primary composite outcome of pain-related function and opioid safety, and secondary outcomes of wellbeing and physical functioning. Participants will have a 50/50 random chance of being assigned to (a) continuing to receive usual care from the PMT or (b) (a) receiving WHC in addition to the usual care provided by the PMT.\n\nBoth groups will receive usual care from the PMT, which will include a baseline evaluation with at least two PMT clinicians. Follow-up appointments will vary based on clinical judgment of the PMT members, but most patients will be followed for at least six months with at least three follow-up appointments. Both groups will complete questionnaires via telephone at (1) baseline, (2) month 1, (3) month 3, (4) month 6, and (5) month 12. The questionnaires will ask about personal characteristics and demographics, pain, physical function, ability to do activities, social support, sleep, mental health, use of medications and health services, and substance use.\n\nIf assigned to participate in PMT-WHC, participants will work with a Whole Health Coach for eight (8) individual sessions. Whole Health Coaching begins by completing a Personalized Health Inventory (PHI), where progress is assessed within eight (8) dimensions of health and wellness: Physical, Emotional, Social, Spiritual, Intellectual, Environmental, Financial, and Occupational health. The Inventory culminates in defining personal values and overall goals for health and wellness (i.e., \"What do you want your health for?\") based on a person's mission, aspiration, and purpose. This will be used to create goals that become part of a Personal Health Plan. The Personal Health Plan emphasizes self-management strategies to manage pain. After the Plan is developed, ongoing support is provided from the Coach in coaching sessions. Coaches will meet with participants on a biweekly basis for the first three (3) months after randomization and on a monthly basis for the final two (2) months, for a total of eight (8) sessions across approximately five (5) months. The sessions with the WHC will be recorded (audio recordings only, no photographs or video recordings). However, participation is still available in this study if participants decline to be recorded.\n\nParticipants may also be selected to participate in a qualitative interview. If selected, the interview covers participant experiences and opinions about working with the PMT, and, if relevant, the WHC. This interview will be recorded and will be approximately 60 minutes. Participants are not required to complete the interview and are still eligible to participate in this research study if the interview portion is declined.\n\nThe study will also evaluate implementation facilitation as a strategy to support PMTs in implementing care for patients with pain and opioid safety concerns. Implementation facilitation will include audit and feedback and other strategies tailored to each site. A budget impact analysis will monitor implementation and intervention costs."

Have a diagnosis of peripheral neuropathic pain in both feet from generalized distal sensory polyneuropathy based on the following criteria\n\n   1. A history of a relevant lesion of the peripheral nervous system, disease, toxic exposure, or no known cause (i.e., idiopathic).\n   2. Pain distribution in a neuroanatomically plausible distribution consistent with a symmetrical generalized polyneuropathy (i.e., with a \"glove and stocking\" distal to proximal gradient).\n   3. DN4 score≥ 4\n3. Have experienced the neuropathic pain in the feet for at least 6 months.\n4. Have at least one of the following sensory signs upon clinical examination: abnormal pinprick perception, allodynia, hyperalgesia, abnormal light touch perception, abnormal vibratory perception, or abnormal proprioception.\n5. Have average daily baseline worst pain intensity in their feet of 4 or greater and less than 10, on a 0-10 numeric rating scale of pain intensity (0 = \"no pain,\" 10= \"most intense pain imaginable\") as measured on the daily diary during screening from at least 5 measurements.\n6. Able to understand and read English. This requirement is to ensure that participants can provide informed consent and complete PROs.\n7. Have been on stable dosages of all pain medications or using all non-pharmacologic treatments for neuropathy pain at consistent frequency for at least 1 month and willing and able to stay on those dosages (or use those frequencies) (except acetaminophen rescue) throughout the duration of the study.\n8. Willing and able to complete electronic patient-reported outcomes at home using a REDCap link.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Exclusion criteria 10, 13, 14, 20 pertain only to trial protocols that include duloxetine.\n\n  * Exclusion criterion 11, 19 pertain only to trial protocols that include pregabalin.\n\n    1. Taking any opioid medication with a daily mean morphine equivalent (MME) of \\> 30.\n    2. Have a different diagnosis of pain in the feet including but not limited to musculoskeletal pain (e.g., foot arthritis, plantar fasciitis) or lumbar sacral radiculopathy that they rate to be worse than their neuropathic pain in their feet, or that in the opinion of the investigator, precludes the participant from rating their neuropathy pain in their feet.\n    3. Have a central cause of neuropathic pain (e.g., demyelinating disease, spinal cord injury, Parkinson's disease).\n    4. Have a history of an inciting traumatic or surgical cause that corresponds with the development of features consistent with a peripheral neuropathy.\n    5. Bilateral polyradiculopathy, with a distal distribution (i.e., symptoms extending into the feet).\n    6. History of acute polyneuropathy (e.g., Guillain-Barre Syndrome, acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy \\[AMSAN\\]) within 6 months prior to Visit 1.\n    7. Have autoimmune-mediated neuropathy (e.g., RA, lupus, Sjogren syndrome, Lyme disease, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)) unless the associated inflammation is controlled and, in the opinion of the investigator, is expected to remain stable throughout the course of the study.\n    8. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in which nociceptive pain from joint deformity confounds assessment of neuropathic pain.\n    9. Have taken the treatment that caused the participant's neuropathy (e.g., neurotoxic chemotherapy, certain HIV therapies) less than 6 months prior to Visit 1.\n    10. Have taken duloxetine (at least 60mg/day) in the past 6 months or have taken duloxetine at any dosage within a week prior to the screening visit.\\*\\*\n    11. Have taken pregabalin (at least 300mg/day) OR gabapentin (at least 1200mg/day) in the past 6 months or have taken pregabalin or gabapentin at any dosage within a week prior to the screening visit.##\n    12. Have ever previously taken BOTH pregabalin (or gabapentin) AND duloxetine at sufficient dosages and for a sufficient length of time that, in the opinion of the investigator, the participant should have experienced pain relief if they were going to respond, but they did not receive benefit from EITHER drug.\n    13. Taking venlafaxine, buproprion, tramadol, or St. John's Wort. Concomitant use of one medication that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin is allowed at certain dosages. (See Appendix A for maximum allowed dosages for common selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs); maximum dosages for other applicable drugs will be decided by the research team leadership composed of a) clinical pharmacist with extensive experience in chronic pain management, b) a physician board-certified in pain medicine and psychiatry, and c) a board-certified neurologist.\\*\\*\n    14.

          "briefSummary": "Patients diagnosed with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), a rare type of tumor in the digestive tractparticipate in this scientific research study, known as a registry study, to help improve understanding and treatment of GIST.\n\nThis study collects medical information and biological samples-such as blood or tumor tissue-from patients. It does not involve new treatments, medications, or medical procedures. The patient's regular medical care will continue as usual, and participation will not require extra appointments or tests.\n\nThe study aims to learn more about how GIST behaves, especially in rare forms such as SDH-deficient or NF1-associated tumors. While targeted drugs are available for many patients, some tumors return or become resistant to treatment. By gathering data from many patients, researchers hope to better understand these challenges, identify risk factors for worse outcomes, and help design future studies and treatments-especially for rare types of GIST.\n\nIf the patient agrees to participate, information will be collected from their medical records, scans (such as CT or MRI), and doctor visits. They may be asked to complete optional questionnaires about their health and quality of life. If they consent, small blood samples (up to 50 ml) may be collected during routine check-ups. If surgery is needed, a small part of the tumor tissue may be stored for research. Other samples-such as saliva, stool, urine, or spinal fluid-may also be collected if they are taken during normal care, to study how bacteria in the body might affect the disease and treatment.\n\nParticipation is completely voluntary. The patient can choose to join or not, and can withdraw at any time without affecting their care or relationship with their doctor. Even if they do not agree to provide biological samples, they can still take part in the study by sharing medical data and scan results.",
          "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, multi-center observational study aiming to collect clinical data from GIST patients and to longitudinally store radiological and pathological material. Additionally, anonymized retrospective data from the period 1995 to 2025 will be supplemented from existing institutional GIST databases. The study does not currently aim to change current clinical practice in treating GIST patients. Instead, it seeks to generate a robust and consistent dataset to capture oncological outcomes, as well as other outcomes that may improve the quality of care (e.g., surgical results, patient and disease-related risk factors, healthcare research), ultimately enhancing the treatment and counseling of GIST patients.\n\nPatients diagnosed with GIST who meet the inclusion criteria are invited to participate in the current study. Eligible patients receive comprehensive information about the proposed treatment, as well as details on the data and materials (clinical, radiological, and pathological) that will be collected. They are informed that participation will not affect their current treatment. Suitable and informed patients who provide consent are enrolled in the prospective cohort study (PCS) and followed prospectively.\n\nFor patients who voluntarily consent to sample collection through the West German Biobank Essen or the externa biobank of üparticipating centers, additional blood samples are collected during planned CT scans of the chest and abdomen-alongside routine blood draws-for storage in the biobank. Patients are also invited to complete optional questionnaires about their quality of life. If a tumor resection is performed, tumor tissue may be stored for research purposes upon consent. If patients choose to continue treatment or follow-up at another center, they may be contacted by phone at regular intervals after giving consent, and asked to complete quality-of-life questionnaires. They may also be asked to share imaging data and medical reports. With consent, the study team will contact the treating physicians to obtain updates on the patient's disease course.\n\nA data collection form has been developed in the REDCap platform at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (IKIM), Essen, Germany. It includes patient- and tumor-related factors, treatment variables, follow-up findings, time to local recurrence, and follow-up status. All participating centers use this shared platform. Retrospective data are stored anonymously, while prospective data are stored pseudonymously. Only the overall study leadership has access to all data.\n\nEach participating reference center can access imaging data (CT or MRI scans) and pathological material (a representative formalin-fixed tumor block) from their own patients. Patient identifiers are removed to ensure confidentiality. All data shared between institutions are de-identified and pseudonymized, and all measures to conceal patient identities are taken. Radiological images are also pseudonymized and stored in the REDCap database. Pathological materials are stored in a decentralized manner within the biobanks of the participating centers. Consent to participate in the biobank is optional.\n\nAfter a subproject is submitted and approved, pseudonymized data are made available to the respective centers. Each center is responsible for entering and storing its own patient data, imaging results, and pathological samples. At the time of analysis, each center is required to provide updated data upon request.\n\nPersonal data are retained only for as long as necessary for study purposes. Data will be deleted no later than 30 years after enrollment. Personal data are only shared with third parties if consent has been given or if a law permits such sharing.\n\nWithin the GISTT Research Consortium, anonymized data may be shared upon request with participating centers in Germany and abroad (within and outside Europe), provided a project proposal has been submitted to the overall study leadership and the research question is deemed meaningful and feasible. It is expected that additional centers will join the study over time. All participating centers may submit project proposals. These centers are typically research-focused sarcoma centers at university hospitals worldwide. Data are shared exclusively in pseudonymized form. The distribution of biological samples is also coordinated through the overall study leadership."

In physiotherapy training, particularly in technically complex subjects like electrotherapy, conventional instruction may fall short in fostering active learning and knowledge retention. Game-based platforms such as Ren'Py offer an opportunity to integrate interactive, scenario-based learning into the curriculum. This study aimed to assess the impact of Ren'Py-based digital materials on learning outcomes by comparing conventional, digital, and hybrid teaching models in an undergraduate electrotherapy course."

          "briefSummary": "Researchers are looking for new ways to treat children with hepatoblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) that has relapsed or is refractory:\n\n* Hepatoblastoma is a common liver cancer in babies and very young children\n* RMS is a cancer that starts in muscle cells, often in a child's head and neck, bladder, arms, or legs\n* Relapsed means the cancer came back after treatment\n* Refractory means the cancer did not respond (get smaller or go away) to treatment\n\nThe study treatment HER3-DXd (also known as MK-1022 or patritumab deruxtecan) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). An ADC attaches to a protein on cancer cells and delivers treatment to destroy those cells. The goals of this study are to learn:\n\n* About the safety of HER3-DXd in children and if they tolerate it\n* What happens to HER3-DXd in children's bodies over time\n* If children who receive HER3-DXd have the cancer get smaller or go away",
          "detailedDescription": "This study will have 2 parts: a safety lead-in to demonstrate a tolerable safety profile and confirm a preliminary recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) (Part 1) followed by an efficacy evaluation (Part 2)."
