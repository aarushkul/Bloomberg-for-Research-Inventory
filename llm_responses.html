Protocol text:
RATIONALE: Studying samples of bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research trial studies bone marrow samples from women with acute myeloid leukemia.
OBJECTIVES:

* Estimate the proportion of acute myeloid leukemia (AMLs) that originate in CD33+ precursors or in which uncontrolled growth is limited to CD33+ precursors.
* Explore whether there is an association between the cellular origin of AML (i.e., origination in CD33+ precursors or not) and cytogenetic, molecular, and other patient characteristics.
* Explore whether overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS), response rate (RR), or relapse rate is improved for patients with AMLs that originate in CD33+ precursors or in which uncontrolled growth is limited to CD33+ precursors compared to patients with clonally involved cells not detected.

OUTLINE: Archived bone marrow samples are analyzed for CD33+ progenitors, X-chromosome inactivation, and somatic mutations (t(8;21), inv(16), FLT3/ITD, NPM1, CEBPA, KIT) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, long-term culture in hypoxic condition in cytokine-containing liquid media, and flow cytometry. Results are then compared with each patient clinical data.

Protocol text:
Tumours of central nervous system (CNS) is the most common type of solid tumour in childhood. In China, there is limited epidemiology information. Released data from Chinese CDC did not include types of CNS tumours and geographic contribution. As the Children&#39;s Neuro-Oncology Group (CNOG) was established in China in May 2017, it makes studies from multiple centers in children&#39;s brain tumors become practical. This retrospective cross-sectional study was aligned on CNOG annual meeting in 2018 and research group was named as CNOG-MC001 (MC, multicenter) collaborative group.
CNS tumours are mostly seen solid tumours in childhood , as the second common malignancy following leukemia in children. The annual age-standardized incidence rate per 1,000,000 person-years (ASR) of CNS tumour in international children&#39;s cancer incidence study is 20-30. In Asia, ASR of paediatric CNS tumours is around 15.0-24.9 in Japan, Korea, Singapore. For Chinese races including mainland of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, ASRs of paediatric CNS tumour are 15.0, 17.4 and 23.8.

In 2017 in Shanghai, Children&#39;s Neuro-Oncology Group (CNOG) was found in 5th CSPN (Chinese Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery) / 9th CPNF (China Pediatric Neurosurgery Forum) conference, with 35 founding member institutions and 30 founding observation member institutions in mainland of China. Based on this progress, national wide registry (CNOG-MC001) was settled to obtain basic information about CNS tumour cases, combined with available epidemiology data from publications to assess current medical situation on paediatric CNS tumours in China. The protocol of CNOG-MC001 was aligned by CSPN and CNOG member institutions in CNOG annual meeting in 2018 and the study ofiicially started right after the meeting on 20181027.

The first step of this study is a national wide pre-survey to all 35 CNOG member institutions and other 22 CSPN members. The pre-survey data sheet included number of annual surgically treated paediatric CNS tumour cases (age ranging from 0 to 18 years old, classified by WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System 2016 version), to assess the proper sites to be involved in this study. After retrieving the pre-survey results, large-scale, detailed case data sheets will be sent to participating institutions as members of CNOG-MC001 collaborative group.
Patients newly diagnosed with CNS tumours in children younger than 18 y/o, who were under in-patient treatment, were labeled as candidate cases in the CNOG-MC001 cohort for reviewing.
It is mandatory that patients recieve surgical treatment for pathological diagnosis of CNS tumours in enrolled patients. Surgical resection of tumours could be regarded as total / subtotal / partial resection and biopsy.
Tumour resection
Baseline information of children with CNS tumours
Baseline information including gender, age, and institutional geographic data are required for epidemiology analysis.
Tumour type and anatomic location
Tumour type according to 2016 edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System (CNS) is mandatory for epidemiology analysis.
Overall Survival
Available overall survival data with post surgery treatments records of enrolled cases is preferred but not mandatory for outcome analysis.
Progression Free Survival
Progression free survival data is preferred but not mandatory for outcome analysis.</pre>

Protocol text:
Tumours of central nervous system (CNS) is the most common type of solid tumour in childhood. In China, there is limited epidemiology information. Released data from Chinese CDC did not include types of CNS tumours and geographic contribution. As the Children&#39;s Neuro-Oncology Group (CNOG) was established in China in May 2017, it makes studies from multiple centers in children&#39;s brain tumors become practical. This retrospective cross-sectional study was aligned on CNOG annual meeting in 2018 and research group was named as CNOG-MC001 (MC, multicenter) collaborative group.
CNS tumours are mostly seen solid tumours in childhood , as the second common malignancy following leukemia in children. The annual age-standardized incidence rate per 1,000,000 person-years (ASR) of CNS tumour in international children&#39;s cancer incidence study is 20-30. In Asia, ASR of paediatric CNS tumours is around 15.0-24.9 in Japan, Korea, Singapore. For Chinese races including mainland of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, ASRs of paediatric CNS tumour are 15.0, 17.4 and 23.8.

In 2017 in Shanghai, Children&#39;s Neuro-Oncology Group (CNOG) was found in 5th CSPN (Chinese Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery) / 9th CPNF (China Pediatric Neurosurgery Forum) conference, with 35 founding member institutions and 30 founding observation member institutions in mainland of China. Based on this progress, national wide registry (CNOG-MC001) was settled to obtain basic information about CNS tumour cases, combined with available epidemiology data from publications to assess current medical situation on paediatric CNS tumours in China. The protocol of CNOG-MC001 was aligned by CSPN and CNOG member institutions in CNOG annual meeting in 2018 and the study ofiicially started right after the meeting on 20181027.

The first step of this study is a national wide pre-survey to all 35 CNOG member institutions and other 22 CSPN members. The pre-survey data sheet included number of annual surgically treated paediatric CNS tumour cases (age ranging from 0 to 18 years old, classified by WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System 2016 version), to assess the proper sites to be involved in this study. After retrieving the pre-survey results, large-scale, detailed case data sheets will be sent to participating institutions as members of CNOG-MC001 collaborative group.
Patients newly diagnosed with CNS tumours in children younger than 18 y/o, who were under in-patient treatment, were labeled as candidate cases in the CNOG-MC001 cohort for reviewing.
It is mandatory that patients recieve surgical treatment for pathological diagnosis of CNS tumours in enrolled patients. Surgical resection of tumours could be regarded as total / subtotal / partial resection and biopsy.

Protocol text:
This protocol will study the impact of Irreversible electroporation (IRE) on immune response in patients diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancers smaller than 5.0 cm. It will profile the immune response to IRE of unresectable pancreatic cancers. The intra-tumoral and systemic immune response to IRE will be determined and compared to pre-ablated pancreatic cancer specimens and historical control specimens.
Thirty patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (≤5.0cm) will undergo percutaneous irreversible electroporation of the tumor using CT and ultrasound guidance. Blood will be drawn for research before IRE. Blood and tissue samples will be used.

After IRE, patients will be carefully monitored and systemic immune responses are registered. Follow-up will consist of frequent CT and MRI scanning, as well as serum CA19.9 tumor marker and quality of life questionnaires and overall survival (OS).

The investigators hypothesize that IRE in the pancreas will induce good symptom palliation without causing severe complications as well as perfect systemic immune response.
90 pulses of 70 microseconds each in duration will be administered per electrode pair.
The patients without treatment
Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a new, minimal-invasive image-guided treatment method for tumors not amenable for surgical resection or thermal ablation, due to vicinity near vital structures such as vessels and bile ducts. With IRE, multiple electrical pulses are applied to tumorous tissue. These pulses alter the existing transmembrane potential of the cell membranes, and create &#39;nanopores&#39;, after which the cell dies through loss of homeostasis.
NanoKnife LEDC System
Characterization of the intra-tumoral and systemic immune response to IRE in unresectable pancreatic cancers
1. Determine number (percentage via flow cytometry), phenotype and functionality of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in ablated pancreatic cancer
2. Determine morphology and histology of regional lymph node after IRE
3. Quantify T cell response (IUs of IL2 and IFN gamma, and T cell specific cells as measured by number of spots on an elispot assay) to tumor associated antigens using in vitro assays of T cell proliferation and function (cytokine release, elispot, peptide-MHC)
Comparison immune response between non-ablated and ablated pancreatic cancer and pre-ablated and post ablated serum
1. Compare serum cytokine and chemokine expression (in IU) between patients undergoing or not undergoing tumor ablation
2. Characterize cytokine and chemokine expression (in IU) in ablated tissue and in pre-ablated and post-ablated serum over time
3. Compare intra-tumoral lymphocyte populations (percentage via flow cytometry) in ablated tumor tissue with paraffin embedded specimens for tumors that are matched for age, tumor size and histology.</pre>

Protocol text:
The aim of project NUSHI is to elucidate, that radial sheath insertion can be performed by nurses and physicians with the same level of comfort and safety.
Background: Insertion of sheath in the radial artery in connection with examination and treatment of patients with coronary artery disease is usually performed by specialized invasive cardiologists or trainees. Whether sheath insertion can be performed by nurses with the same level of comfort and pain is uncertain.

Eligibility: Patients referred for coronary angiography (CAG) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to suspicion of coronary artery disease are included

Randomization: Patients are randomized 1:1 to sheath insertion by nurse or physician

Methods: Insertion of 5 or 6 radial sheaths is performed in local anesthesia

Outcome measures: Comfort and pain level is registered from immediately after sheath insertion until start of CAG/PCI.

Additional outcome measures: Oximetry test is performed immediately after sheath removal - and repeated after 1 month in case of occlusion. Any complication is recorded from the patient enters the wake-up room until discharge.

All patients are contacted after 1 year in order to register adverse events.
radial sheath insertion is performed by physicians
radial sheath insertion is performed by nurses
radial sheaths for coronary examination and intervention are performed by experienced nurses
nurse-led sheath insertion
pain level
pain level during sheath insertion is measured using a 1 to 10 point numeric rating scale. For pain registration: 0 is no pain and 10 the worst imaginable pain.
comfort level
comfort level during sheath insertion is measured using a 1 to 10 point numeric rating scale. For comfort: 0 is no comfort at all and 10 is the best imaginable comfort.
success rate
success rate with regard to successful sheath insertion is assured
time consumption
time consumption for both groups
convertion
successful conversion yes/no from physician to nurse or from nurse to physician determined by the possibility to accomplish the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure
complications
occurrence of radial occlusion, perforation, pseudoaneurysm, and compartment syndrome</pre>

Protocol text:
RATIONALE: Studying samples of bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research trial studies bone marrow samples from women with acute myeloid leukemia.
OBJECTIVES:

* Estimate the proportion of acute myeloid leukemia (AMLs) that originate in CD33+ precursors or in which uncontrolled growth is limited to CD33+ precursors.
* Explore whether there is an association between the cellular origin of AML (i.e., origination in CD33+ precursors or not) and cytogenetic, molecular, and other patient characteristics.
* Explore whether overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS), response rate (RR), or relapse rate is improved for patients with AMLs that originate in CD33+ precursors or in which uncontrolled growth is limited to CD33+ precursors compared to patients with clonally involved cells not detected.

OUTLINE: Archived bone marrow samples are analyzed for CD33+ progenitors, X-chromosome inactivation, and somatic mutations (t(8;21), inv(16), FLT3/ITD, NPM1, CEBPA, KIT) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, long-term culture in hypoxic condition in cytokine-containing liquid media, and flow cytometry. Results are then compared with each patient clinical data.
gene expression analysis
flow cytometry
fluorescence activated cell sorting
laboratory biomarker analysis
medical chart review
Association between CD33+ precursors and cytogenetic and/or molecular risks using Fisher&#39;s exact test
Relationship between emergence of individual mutations [t(8;21), inv(16), FLT3/ITD, NPM1, CEBPA, and KIT], clonality, and stage of cell differentiation using Fisher&#39;s exact test
Associations between survival outcomes (OS, EFS, DFS, RR, and relapse rate) and CD33+ restriction using regression analysis</pre>

Protocol text:
Tumours of central nervous system (CNS) is the most common type of solid tumour in childhood. In China, there is limited epidemiology information. Released data from Chinese CDC did not include types of CNS tumours and geographic contribution. As the Children&#39;s Neuro-Oncology Group (CNOG) was established in China in May 2017, it makes studies from multiple centers in children&#39;s brain tumors become practical. This retrospective cross-sectional study was aligned on CNOG annual meeting in 2018 and research group was named as CNOG-MC001 (MC, multicenter) collaborative group.
CNS tumours are mostly seen solid tumours in childhood , as the second common malignancy following leukemia in children. The annual age-standardized incidence rate per 1,000,000 person-years (ASR) of CNS tumour in international children&#39;s cancer incidence study is 20-30. In Asia, ASR of paediatric CNS tumours is around 15.0-24.9 in Japan, Korea, Singapore. For Chinese races including mainland of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, ASRs of paediatric CNS tumour are 15.0, 17.4 and 23.8.

In 2017 in Shanghai, Children&#39;s Neuro-Oncology Group (CNOG) was found in 5th CSPN (Chinese Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery) / 9th CPNF (China Pediatric Neurosurgery Forum) conference, with 35 founding member institutions and 30 founding observation member institutions in mainland of China. Based on this progress, national wide registry (CNOG-MC001) was settled to obtain basic information about CNS tumour cases, combined with available epidemiology data from publications to assess current medical situation on paediatric CNS tumours in China. The protocol of CNOG-MC001 was aligned by CSPN and CNOG member institutions in CNOG annual meeting in 2018 and the study ofiicially started right after the meeting on 20181027.

The first step of this study is a national wide pre-survey to all 35 CNOG member institutions and other 22 CSPN members. The pre-survey data sheet included number of annual surgically treated paediatric CNS tumour cases (age ranging from 0 to 18 years old, classified by WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System 2016 version), to assess the proper sites to be involved in this study. After retrieving the pre-survey results, large-scale, detailed case data sheets will be sent to participating institutions as members of CNOG-MC001 collaborative group.
Patients newly diagnosed with CNS tumours in children younger than 18 y/o, who were under in-patient treatment, were labeled as candidate cases in the CNOG-MC001 cohort for reviewing.
It is mandatory that patients recieve surgical treatment for pathological diagnosis of CNS tumours in enrolled patients. Surgical resection of tumours could be regarded as total / subtotal / partial resection and biopsy.
Tumour resection
Baseline information of children with CNS tumours
Baseline information including gender, age, and institutional geographic data are required for epidemiology analysis.
Tumour type and anatomic location
Tumour type according to 2016 edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System (CNS) is mandatory for epidemiology analysis.
Overall Survival
Available overall survival data with post surgery treatments records of enrolled cases is preferred but not mandatory for outcome analysis.
Progression Free Survival
Progression free survival data is preferred but not mandatory for outcome analysis.</pre>

<h3>Prompt</h3>
<pre>You are an analyst that maps clinical trial protocols to reagent demand.
Trial identifier: NCT02343835
Lab or sponsor: Unknown Lab
Given the protocol excerpt below, list the reagents, consumables, or cell lines required.
For each item provide: lab_name, need_level (High/Medium/Low), product_category, supplier_name, reagent_name, inventory_qty (integer), expected_demand (integer), signal_strength (high/medium/low), and notes describing why it is needed.
Return ONLY a JSON array of objects with those keys. Example:

Protocol text:
This protocol will study the impact of Irreversible electroporation (IRE) on immune response in patients diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancers smaller than 5.0 cm. It will profile the immune response to IRE of unresectable pancreatic cancers. The intra-tumoral and systemic immune response to IRE will be determined and compared to pre-ablated pancreatic cancer specimens and historical control specimens.
Thirty patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (≤5.0cm) will undergo percutaneous irreversible electroporation of the tumor using CT and ultrasound guidance. Blood will be drawn for research before IRE. Blood and tissue samples will be used.

After IRE, patients will be carefully monitored and systemic immune responses are registered. Follow-up will consist of frequent CT and MRI scanning, as well as serum CA19.9 tumor marker and quality of life questionnaires and overall survival (OS).

The investigators hypothesize that IRE in the pancreas will induce good symptom palliation without causing severe complications as well as perfect systemic immune response.
90 pulses of 70 microseconds each in duration will be administered per electrode pair.
The patients without treatment
Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a new, minimal-invasive image-guided treatment method for tumors not amenable for surgical resection or thermal ablation, due to vicinity near vital structures such as vessels and bile ducts. With IRE, multiple electrical pulses are applied to tumorous tissue. These pulses alter the existing transmembrane potential of the cell membranes, and create &#39;nanopores&#39;, after which the cell dies through loss of homeostasis.
NanoKnife LEDC System
Characterization of the intra-tumoral and systemic immune response to IRE in unresectable pancreatic cancers
1. Determine number (percentage via flow cytometry), phenotype and functionality of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in ablated pancreatic cancer
2. Determine morphology and histology of regional lymph node after IRE
3. Quantify T cell response (IUs of IL2 and IFN gamma, and T cell specific cells as measured by number of spots on an elispot assay) to tumor associated antigens using in vitro assays of T cell proliferation and function (cytokine release, elispot, peptide-MHC)
Comparison immune response between non-ablated and ablated pancreatic cancer and pre-ablated and post ablated serum
1. Compare serum cytokine and chemokine expression (in IU) between patients undergoing or not undergoing tumor ablation
2. Characterize cytokine and chemokine expression (in IU) in ablated tissue and in pre-ablated and post-ablated serum over time
3. Compare intra-tumoral lymphocyte populations (percentage via flow cytometry) in ablated tumor tissue with paraffin embedded specimens for tumors that are matched for age, tumor size and histology.</pre>

Protocol text:
The aim of project NUSHI is to elucidate, that radial sheath insertion can be performed by nurses and physicians with the same level of comfort and safety.
Background: Insertion of sheath in the radial artery in connection with examination and treatment of patients with coronary artery disease is usually performed by specialized invasive cardiologists or trainees. Whether sheath insertion can be performed by nurses with the same level of comfort and pain is uncertain.

Eligibility: Patients referred for coronary angiography (CAG) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to suspicion of coronary artery disease are included

Randomization: Patients are randomized 1:1 to sheath insertion by nurse or physician

Methods: Insertion of 5 or 6 radial sheaths is performed in local anesthesia

Outcome measures: Comfort and pain level is registered from immediately after sheath insertion until start of CAG/PCI.

Additional outcome measures: Oximetry test is performed immediately after sheath removal - and repeated after 1 month in case of occlusion. Any complication is recorded from the patient enters the wake-up room until discharge.

All patients are contacted after 1 year in order to register adverse events.
radial sheath insertion is performed by physicians
radial sheath insertion is performed by nurses
radial sheaths for coronary examination and intervention are performed by experienced nurses
nurse-led sheath insertion
pain level
pain level during sheath insertion is measured using a 1 to 10 point numeric rating scale. For pain registration: 0 is no pain and 10 the worst imaginable pain.
comfort level
comfort level during sheath insertion is measured using a 1 to 10 point numeric rating scale. For comfort: 0 is no comfort at all and 10 is the best imaginable comfort.
success rate
success rate with regard to successful sheath insertion is assured
time consumption
time consumption for both groups
convertion
successful conversion yes/no from physician to nurse or from nurse to physician determined by the possibility to accomplish the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure
complications
occurrence of radial occlusion, perforation, pseudoaneurysm, and compartment syndrome</pre>

Protocol text:
RATIONALE: Studying samples of bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research trial studies bone marrow samples from women with acute myeloid leukemia.
OBJECTIVES:

* Estimate the proportion of acute myeloid leukemia (AMLs) that originate in CD33+ precursors or in which uncontrolled growth is limited to CD33+ precursors.
* Explore whether there is an association between the cellular origin of AML (i.e., origination in CD33+ precursors or not) and cytogenetic, molecular, and other patient characteristics.
* Explore whether overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS), response rate (RR), or relapse rate is improved for patients with AMLs that originate in CD33+ precursors or in which uncontrolled growth is limited to CD33+ precursors compared to patients with clonally involved cells not detected.

OUTLINE: Archived bone marrow samples are analyzed for CD33+ progenitors, X-chromosome inactivation, and somatic mutations (t(8;21), inv(16), FLT3/ITD, NPM1, CEBPA, KIT) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, long-term culture in hypoxic condition in cytokine-containing liquid media, and flow cytometry. Results are then compared with each patient clinical data.

Protocol text:
Tumours of central nervous system (CNS) is the most common type of solid tumour in childhood. In China, there is limited epidemiology information. Released data from Chinese CDC did not include types of CNS tumours and geographic contribution. As the Children&#39;s Neuro-Oncology Group (CNOG) was established in China in May 2017, it makes studies from multiple centers in children&#39;s brain tumors become practical. This retrospective cross-sectional study was aligned on CNOG annual meeting in 2018 and research group was named as CNOG-MC001 (MC, multicenter) collaborative group.
CNS tumours are mostly seen solid tumours in childhood , as the second common malignancy following leukemia in children. The annual age-standardized incidence rate per 1,000,000 person-years (ASR) of CNS tumour in international children&#39;s cancer incidence study is 20-30. In Asia, ASR of paediatric CNS tumours is around 15.0-24.9 in Japan, Korea, Singapore. For Chinese races including mainland of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, ASRs of paediatric CNS tumour are 15.0, 17.4 and 23.8.

In 2017 in Shanghai, Children&#39;s Neuro-Oncology Group (CNOG) was found in 5th CSPN (Chinese Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery) / 9th CPNF (China Pediatric Neurosurgery Forum) conference, with 35 founding member institutions and 30 founding observation member institutions in mainland of China. Based on this progress, national wide registry (CNOG-MC001) was settled to obtain basic information about CNS tumour cases, combined with available epidemiology data from publications to assess current medical situation on paediatric CNS tumours in China. The protocol of CNOG-MC001 was aligned by CSPN and CNOG member institutions in CNOG annual meeting in 2018 and the study ofiicially started right after the meeting on 20181027.

The first step of this study is a national wide pre-survey to all 35 CNOG member institutions and other 22 CSPN members. The pre-survey data sheet included number of annual surgically treated paediatric CNS tumour cases (age ranging from 0 to 18 years old, classified by WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System 2016 version), to assess the proper sites to be involved in this study. After retrieving the pre-survey results, large-scale, detailed case data sheets will be sent to participating institutions as members of CNOG-MC001 collaborative group.
Patients newly diagnosed with CNS tumours in children younger than 18 y/o, who were under in-patient treatment, were labeled as candidate cases in the CNOG-MC001 cohort for reviewing.
It is mandatory that patients recieve surgical treatment for pathological diagnosis of CNS tumours in enrolled patients. Surgical resection of tumours could be regarded as total / subtotal / partial resection and biopsy.
Tumour resection
Baseline information of children with CNS tumours
Baseline information including gender, age, and institutional geographic data are required for epidemiology analysis.
Tumour type and anatomic location
Tumour type according to 2016 edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System (CNS) is mandatory for epidemiology analysis.
Overall Survival
Available overall survival data with post surgery treatments records of enrolled cases is preferred but not mandatory for outcome analysis.
Progression Free Survival
Progression free survival data is preferred but not mandatory for outcome analysis.</pre>

<h3>Prompt</h3>
<pre>You are an analyst that maps clinical trial protocols to reagent demand.
Trial identifier: NCT02343835
Lab or sponsor: Unknown Lab
Given the protocol excerpt below, list the reagents, consumables, or cell lines required.
For each item provide: lab_name, need_level (High/Medium/Low), product_category, supplier_name, reagent_name, inventory_qty (integer), expected_demand (integer), signal_strength (high/medium/low), and notes describing why it is needed.
Return ONLY a JSON array of objects with those keys. Example:

Protocol text:
This protocol will study the impact of Irreversible electroporation (IRE) on immune response in patients diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancers smaller than 5.0 cm. It will profile the immune response to IRE of unresectable pancreatic cancers. The intra-tumoral and systemic immune response to IRE will be determined and compared to pre-ablated pancreatic cancer specimens and historical control specimens.
Thirty patients with histologically confirmed locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (≤5.0cm) will undergo percutaneous irreversible electroporation of the tumor using CT and ultrasound guidance. Blood will be drawn for research before IRE. Blood and tissue samples will be used.

After IRE, patients will be carefully monitored and systemic immune responses are registered. Follow-up will consist of frequent CT and MRI scanning, as well as serum CA19.9 tumor marker and quality of life questionnaires and overall survival (OS).

The investigators hypothesize that IRE in the pancreas will induce good symptom palliation without causing severe complications as well as perfect systemic immune response.
90 pulses of 70 microseconds each in duration will be administered per electrode pair.
The patients without treatment
Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a new, minimal-invasive image-guided treatment method for tumors not amenable for surgical resection or thermal ablation, due to vicinity near vital structures such as vessels and bile ducts. With IRE, multiple electrical pulses are applied to tumorous tissue. These pulses alter the existing transmembrane potential of the cell membranes, and create &#39;nanopores&#39;, after which the cell dies through loss of homeostasis.
NanoKnife LEDC System
Characterization of the intra-tumoral and systemic immune response to IRE in unresectable pancreatic cancers
1. Determine number (percentage via flow cytometry), phenotype and functionality of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in ablated pancreatic cancer
2. Determine morphology and histology of regional lymph node after IRE
3. Quantify T cell response (IUs of IL2 and IFN gamma, and T cell specific cells as measured by number of spots on an elispot assay) to tumor associated antigens using in vitro assays of T cell proliferation and function (cytokine release, elispot, peptide-MHC)
Comparison immune response between non-ablated and ablated pancreatic cancer and pre-ablated and post ablated serum
1. Compare serum cytokine and chemokine expression (in IU) between patients undergoing or not undergoing tumor ablation
2. Characterize cytokine and chemokine expression (in IU) in ablated tissue and in pre-ablated and post-ablated serum over time
3. Compare intra-tumoral lymphocyte populations (percentage via flow cytometry) in ablated tumor tissue with paraffin embedded specimens for tumors that are matched for age, tumor size and histology.</pre>

Protocol text:
The aim of project NUSHI is to elucidate, that radial sheath insertion can be performed by nurses and physicians with the same level of comfort and safety.
Background: Insertion of sheath in the radial artery in connection with examination and treatment of patients with coronary artery disease is usually performed by specialized invasive cardiologists or trainees. Whether sheath insertion can be performed by nurses with the same level of comfort and pain is uncertain.

Eligibility: Patients referred for coronary angiography (CAG) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to suspicion of coronary artery disease are included

Randomization: Patients are randomized 1:1 to sheath insertion by nurse or physician

Methods: Insertion of 5 or 6 radial sheaths is performed in local anesthesia

Outcome measures: Comfort and pain level is registered from immediately after sheath insertion until start of CAG/PCI.

Additional outcome measures: Oximetry test is performed immediately after sheath removal - and repeated after 1 month in case of occlusion. Any complication is recorded from the patient enters the wake-up room until discharge.

All patients are contacted after 1 year in order to register adverse events.
radial sheath insertion is performed by physicians
radial sheath insertion is performed by nurses
radial sheaths for coronary examination and intervention are performed by experienced nurses
nurse-led sheath insertion
pain level
pain level during sheath insertion is measured using a 1 to 10 point numeric rating scale. For pain registration: 0 is no pain and 10 the worst imaginable pain.
comfort level
comfort level during sheath insertion is measured using a 1 to 10 point numeric rating scale. For comfort: 0 is no comfort at all and 10 is the best imaginable comfort.
success rate
success rate with regard to successful sheath insertion is assured
time consumption
time consumption for both groups
convertion
successful conversion yes/no from physician to nurse or from nurse to physician determined by the possibility to accomplish the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure
complications
